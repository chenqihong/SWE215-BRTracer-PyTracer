    <h1>Local debugging</h1>

    <p>The Java debugger has a client/server design so that it can be used to
    debug programs that run locally (on the same workstation as the debugger) or
    remotely (on another computer on the network).</p>

    <p>Local debugging is the simplest and most common kind of debugging.&nbsp;
    After you have finished editing and building your Java program, you can
    launch the program on your workstation using the <strong>Run &gt; Debug...</strong> menu item
    on the workbench.&nbsp; Launching the program in this way will establish a
    connection between the debugger client and the Java program that you are
    launching.&nbsp; You may then use breakpoints, stepping, or expression
    evaluation to debug your program.</p>
