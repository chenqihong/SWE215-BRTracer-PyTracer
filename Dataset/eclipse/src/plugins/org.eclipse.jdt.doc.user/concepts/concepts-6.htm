    <h1>Java views</h1>

    <p>The Java development tools contribute the following views to the workbench:</p>

    <h2>Package Explorer view</h2>

    <p>The Package Explorer view shows the Java element hierarchy of the Java projects in your workbench.
    It provides you with a Java-specific view of the resources shown in the
    Navigator. The element hierarchy is derived from the project's build class paths.
    <br>For each project, its source folders and referenced libraries are shown in the tree.
    You can open and browse the contents of both internal and external JAR files.</p>

    <h2>Hierarchy view</h2>

    <p>The Hierarchy view allows you to look at the complete hierarchy for a
    type, only its subtypes, or only its supertypes.</p>

    <h2>Projects view</h2>

    <p>The Projects view shows Java projects, source folders, external and internal libraries.
    <br>
    Note: source folders and libraries (both internal and external) presented in this view are not expandable.
    When they are selected, their contents are shown in the Packages view.</p>

    <h2>Packages view</h2>

    <p>The Packages view shows a list of Java packages from the currently selected Java projects, source folders or libraries.
    Typically, the Projects view is used to make this selection.
    </p>

    <h2>Types view</h2>

    <p>The Types view shows a list of Java types from the currently selected packages.
    Typically, the Packages view is used to make this selection.
    </p>

    <h2>Members view</h2>

    <p>The Members shows the content of a type, compilation unit or CLASS file.
    Typically, the Types view is used to make this selection.
