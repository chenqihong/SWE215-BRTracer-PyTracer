    <h1>Remote debugging</h1>

    <p>The client/server design of the Java debugger allows you to launch a Java
    program from computer on your network and debug it from the workstation
    running the platform.&nbsp; This is particularly useful when you are
    developing a program for a device that cannot host the development
    platform.&nbsp; It is also useful when debugging programs on dedicated
    machines such as web servers.&nbsp; </p>

    <p>Note:&nbsp; To use remote debugging, you must be using a Java VM that
    supports this feature.</p>

    <p>To debug a program remotely, you must be able to launch the program in
    debug mode on the remote machine so that it will wait for a connection from
    your debugger.&nbsp; The specific technique for launching the program and
    connecting the debugger are VM-specific.&nbsp; The basic steps are as
    follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Ensure that you are building your Java program with available debug
        information.&nbsp; (You can control these attributes from <strong>Window
        &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Compiler</strong>).&nbsp; </li>
      <li>After you build your Java program, install it to the target
        computer.&nbsp; This involves copying the .CLASS files or .JAR files to
        the appropriate location on the remote computer.</li>
      <li>Invoke the Java program on the remote computer using the appropriate
        VM arguments to specify debug mode and a communication port for the
        debugger.</li>
      <li>Start the debugger using a remote launch configuration and specify the
        address and port of the remote computer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>More specific instructions for setting up a launch configuration for
    remote debugging should be obtained from your VM provider.&nbsp; </p>
