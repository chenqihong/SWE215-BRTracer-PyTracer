    <h1>Java builder</h1>

    <p>The Java builder builds Java programs using a compiler that implements the Java Language Specification.&nbsp;
    The Java builder can build programs incrementally as individual Java files are saved.</p>

    <p>Problems detected by the compiler are classified as either warnings or errors. The existence of a warning does not affect the execution of the program; the code executes as
    if it were written correctly. Compile-time errors (as specified by the Java Language Specification) are always reported as errors by the Java compiler. For some other types of
    problems you can, however, specify if you want the Java compiler to report them as warnings, errors or to ignore them. To change the default settings, use the <span class=
    "control">Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Compiler &gt; Errors/Warnings</span> preference page.</p>

    <p>The Java compiler can create CLASS files even in presence of compilation errors. However, in the case of serious errors (for example, references to inconsistent binaries,
    most likely related to an invalid build path), the Java builder does not produce any CLASS
    files.</p>
