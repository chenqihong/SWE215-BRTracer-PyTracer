    <h1>
      Adding new methods
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start adding a method by typing the following at the end of the <em>VectorTest.java</em> file (but before the closing 
        brackets of the type) in the Java editor:<br>
        <code>public void testSizeIsThree()</code><br>
		As soon as you type the method name in the editor area, the new method appears at the bottom of the Outline view. 
		<p>

		</p>
		In addition, error annotations (red boxes) appear in the overview ruler positioned on the right hand side 
		of the editor. These error annotations indicate that the compilation unit is currently not correct. If you hover
		over the second red box, a tool tip appears: <em>Unmatched bracket</em>; <em>Syntax error on token &quot;)&quot;, 
		{ expected after this token</em>, which is correct since the method doesn't have a body yet. Note that error 
		annotations in the editor's rulers are updated as you type. This behavior can be controlled via  the
		<STRONG>Report problems as you type</STRONG> option located on the preference page <strong>Java &gt; 
		Editor</strong>.
		<p>

		</p>
		
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <strong>Save</strong> button. The compilation unit is compiled automatically and errors appear in the 
        Package Explorer view, in the Problems view and on the vertical ruler (left hand side of the editor). In the Package 
        Explorer view, the errors are propagated up to the project of the compilation unit containing the error.

      </li>
      <li>
        Complete the new method by typing the following:<br>
        <p><code>
          {<br>
          &nbsp; assertTrue(fFull.size() == 3);<br>
        </code></p>
        Note that the closing curly bracket has been auto inserted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Save the file. Notice that the error indicators disappear since the
        missing bracket has been added.
      </li>
    </ol>
