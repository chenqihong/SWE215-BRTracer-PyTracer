    <ol>
      <li>
        In the Navigator or Package Explorer, you can optionally select the source folder into which you wish to import the source. <em>Note: It is important to choose a source
        container; otherwise, the imported files will not be on the build path.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        From the workbench menu bar, select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Import</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        In the&nbsp;<strong>Zip file</strong> field, type or browse to select the file from which you would like to add the resources. In the import selection
        panes, use the following methods to select exactly the resources you want to add: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Expand the hierarchies in the left pane and check or clear the boxes representing the containers in the selected directory. Then in the right pane, select or clear
            boxes for individual files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click <strong>Select Types</strong> to select specific file types to add.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click <strong>Select All</strong> to select all files in the directory, then go through and deselect the ones that you don't want to add.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click <strong>Deselect All</strong> to deselect all files in the directory, then go through and choose individual files to add.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <strong>Select the destination for imported resources</strong> field, type or browse to select a workbench container for the added resources (if it was not
        already selected when you activated the&nbsp;<strong>Import</strong> command).
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <strong>Options</strong> area, you can choose whether or not to overwrite existing resources without warning.
      </li>
