    <h1>
      Applying hit counts
    </h1>
    <p>
      A hit count can be applied to line breakpoints, exception breakpoints, watchpoints and method breakpoints. When a hit count is applied to a breakpoint, the breakpoint
      suspends execution of a thread the <em>n</em>th time it is hit, but never again, until it is re-enabled or the hit count is changed or disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      To set a hit count on a breakpoint:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select the breakpoint to which a hit count is to be added.
      </li>
      <li>
        From the breakpoint's pop-up menu, select <strong><strong>Hit Count</strong></strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <strong><strong>Enter the new hit count for the breakpoint</strong></strong> field, type the number of times you want to hit the breakpoint before suspending
        execution.<br>
        <br>
         <strong>Note:</strong> When the breakpoint is hit for the <em>n</em>th time, the thread that hit the breakpoint suspends. The breakpoint is disabled until either it is
        re-enabled or its hit count is changed.
      </li>
    </ol>
