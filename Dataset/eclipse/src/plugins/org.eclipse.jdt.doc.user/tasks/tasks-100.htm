    <h1>
      Undoing a refactoring operation
    </h1>
    <p>
      The most recent refactoring can be undone as long as you have not modified any Java elements in the workbench.
      After performing a refactoring operation, you can build the
      project, run and debug it, and execute any test cases, and still undo the refactoring action.
    </p>
    <p>
      To undo the most recent refactoring, select <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>Undo</strong> from the menu bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong>: If the workbench contains unsaved files that affect undoing the refactoring, an error dialog appears.
      The dialog contains a list of files that must be
      reverted to their saved editions before the refactoring can be completed.
