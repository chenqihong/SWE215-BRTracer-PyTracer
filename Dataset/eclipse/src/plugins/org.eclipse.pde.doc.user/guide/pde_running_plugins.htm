<h2>Choosing plug-ins to run</h2>
<p>By default, the Eclipse application is launched with all the workspace plug-ins 
  and all the plug-ins selected on the <strong>Plug-in Development &gt; Target 
  Platform</strong> preference page.</p>
<p>It is possible however to hand-select a subset of plug-ins to launch with on 
  the <strong>Plug-ins</strong> tab of the launch configuration.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/launch-plugins.png" alt="Run-time workbench launcher - plug-ins and fragments" ></p>
<p> This gives you great flexibility, but with flexibility comes the danger of 
  ending up with an invalid configuration. Use this feature carefully and press 
  the <strong>Validate Plug-in Set </strong>often to ensure that all inter-plug-in 
  dependencies in your subset are satisfied.</p>
