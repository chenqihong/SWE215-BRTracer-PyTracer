<h2>Building plug-ins, fragments and features using update site editor</h2>
<p align="left">
Building an update site is a relatively simple task and most of the work is done 
on the <b>Features</b> page of the update site editor.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/site-features.png" ></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
Features added to the <b>Managing the Site</b> section will be built recursively
when you press <b>Build All</b>.&nbsp; This means that the features and all the
plug-ins and fragments they include will be built in one batch operation.&nbsp; 
The feature JARs end up in the <b>features/</b> folder of your site project and
the plug-in JARs are placed in the <b>plugins/</b> folder of your site project.</p>
<p align="left">
If you would like to build one feature, select a feature and press the <b>Build</b> 
button..</p>
<p align="left">
If you are dealing with features that include other features, only the root 
feature needs to be listed, since its child features will automatically be 
built.</p>
<p align="left">Features that have environment constraints need to specify environments
  in the<b>  Feature Environments</b> section. Select a feature and fill in the
  values, or press <b>Synchronize...</b> button and let the environment be copied
  from feature manifest to the site.</p>
<p align="left">
For easy browsing of your features on your update site, you can create 
categories and organize your published features in these categories.&nbsp; A 
feature may appear in &gt;= 0 categories.</p>
<p align="left">
To preview on what your web site would look like, save the site.xml file and
  open 
the index.html file at the root of your site project in a browser.</p>
