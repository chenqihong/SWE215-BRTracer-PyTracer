<h1>Preparing the workbench</h1>
<p>While you can access the PDE platform contributions from any perspective, the 
PDE perspective is arguably the best.&nbsp; </p>
<p>From the default Resource perspective, open the PDE perspective via 
<b>Window &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Other...
</b> and
choose <b>Plug-in Development</b> from the offered list.</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="images/pdeperspective.png" alt="PDE perspective"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the main views and toolbar actions that are useful for Java 
development, the PDE perspective adds shortcuts to very frequently used wizards 
such as the New Plug-in Project creation wizard, etc.  It also adds 
views that are very important to a plug-in developer including the <b>Error Log</b> 
view.</p>
<h2>Error Log</h2>
<p>The <b>Error Log</b> view captures all internal warnings and errors thrown by the platform 
and by your code.&nbsp;
These errors are written to a <b>.log</b> file that is located in the <b>
.metadata</b> subdirectory of your workspace, and the Error Log view shows the 
content of this file with a variety of convenient options such as filtering, 
sorting, etc.</p>
<p>By default, once the Error Log view is in your workspace, it will be brought 
to the front upon the logging of new events.&nbsp; This feature can be turned 
on/off in the drop down menu of the view.</p>
<p>Other features of the log view include the ability to import any arbitrary 
log file into the view, and to export the log contents into a file.</p>
