<h2>Feature manifest editor</h2>
<p>The feature manifest editor uses the same concepts seen in the other PDE editors. 
</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/feature-overview.png" alt="Feature manifest editor - Overview page" ></p>
<p align="left">Information that is entered during the feature project setup can 
  be changed on the Overview page. In addition, you can provide anr <b> update 
  site</b> URL to be used by the Update Manager when searching for new updates.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p align="left">Branding information for primary features is stored in a 
branding plug-in. If not explicitly set, Eclipse will assume that the branding 
plug-in has the same identifier as the feature.</p>
<p align="left">By default, your feature is treated as universally portable. You 
  can add constraints by providing supported operating/windowing systems, languages 
  and/or system architectures. This information will be used to ensure that your 
  feature is not installed or shown in the context that does not match these constraints.</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="images/feature-overview-info.png" alt="Feature manifest editor - Information page" ></p>
<p align="left">Features are required to provide description, license and copyright 
  information. This information can be edited on the Information page. Each of 
  these three categories can be represented as either text or a URL that points 
  to a valid HTML page. Although URL can be absolute, HTML pages are typically 
  provided with the feature and URLs are relative to the project root.</p>
<p align="left">The <strong>Sites To Visit</strong> tab lists URLs that are used 
  to point users to other interesting features and/or sites.</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="images/feature-content.png" alt="Feature manifest editor - Content page" ></p>
<p align="left">The plug-ins and fragments to be packaged in this feature are 
  listed on the <strong>Plug-ins</strong> page. If a plug-in and/or fragment contains 
  platform-specific code, then environment conditions should be specified and 
  associated with that plug-in or fragment.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/included-features.PNG" alt="Included Features"></p>
<p align="left">A feature may include other features, thus creating a feature 
  hierarchy. When the feature is built, all included features are recursively 
  built and packaged.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/feature-dependencies.PNG" alt="Feature dependencies"></p>
<p align="left">This section lists all features and plug-ins that must be present 
  in the product before the Update Manager installs this feature. If any of these 
  pre-requisites is missing, the feature will not be installed. The requirement 
  can be based solely on plug-in IDs, or further constrained using expected versions 
  and match rules.</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="images/feature-advanced.png" alt="Feature Installations page" ></p>
<p align="left">In addition to plug-ins, opaque data entries can be specified 
  to carry custom feature information. These entries usually come together with 
  custom install handlers. Install handlers can be used to perform non-standard 
  install tasks and manipulate data entries once they are downloaded by the Update 
  Manager. You can read more about this and other feature issues in Platform Install 
  and Update guide.</p>
