<h2>Build configuration page</h2>
<p>The <b>Build Configuration</b> page contains all the information needed to 
build, package and export the plug-in.&nbsp; It appears as a page in the plug-in 
manifest editor, but note that changes made to it will be written by PDE to the
<b>build.properties</b> file of the plug-in.&nbsp; This file solely guides the 
build process.</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="images/build-editor.png" alt="Build Editor" border="0" >.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The <b>Runtime Information</b> section lists all the libraries 
  that you want to build.&nbsp; For each library, you must list the source folder(s) 
  that will be compiled into the library.</p>
<p align="left">If your plug-in declares more than one library, order them 
correctly using the Up and Down button, so that they get compiled in the correct 
order.</p>
<p align="left">The <b>Binary Build</b> section is where you select all the 
files and folders that will make it into the packaged plug-in.&nbsp; In this 
example, you will see that we only want to the plugin.xml file, icons folder and 
the xyz.jar to end up in the packaged plug-in.</p>
<p align="left">The <b>Source Build </b>section has a specialized purpose and is not commonly used or needed by the general population.&nbsp; It is 
needed only when you are shipping source in separate plug-ins and features than 
the binary plug-ins.&nbsp; See the
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_pde_core_source.html">
org.eclipse.pde.core.source</a> extension point for details.</p>
<p align="left">If the libraries you want to build include libraries that are 
NOT listed on the Runtime page, and you need extra libraries on the build 
path for them to compile, you can add these required JARs in the <b>Extra 
Classpath Entries</b> section.</p>
