<h2>Exporting a Product</h2>
<p>From the Exporting section of the product editor, click on the <em>Eclipse 
  product export wizard </em>to bring up the wizard.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/product-export.PNG" alt="Product Export Wizard"></p>
<p align="left">The root directory refers the name of the top-level directory 
  of your product. You can name it anything you like and can be more than one 
  segment. </p>
<p align="left">The synchronization option also appears in the wizard and is checked 
  by default to make sure that your plugin.xml does not contain stale data and 
  is updated with the latest content from the product configuration.</p>
<p align="left">A product can be exported to an archive or a directory. Select 
  the <strong>directory</strong> option. Enter the name of a directory and Press 
  <strong>Finish</strong>.</p>
<p align="left">When the operation completes, go to that directory and launch 
  your new customized product.</p>
<p align="left">Simple as that!</p>
