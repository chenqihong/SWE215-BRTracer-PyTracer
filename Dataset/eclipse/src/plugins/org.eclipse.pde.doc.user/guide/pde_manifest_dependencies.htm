<h2>Dependencies page</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dependencies</strong> page shows the dependencies that your plug-in 
  has on other plug-ins.&nbsp; You must list on this page all the plug-ins that 
  contribute code required on your plug-in project's classpath to compile.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  When you modify the list of dependencies and save the file, PDE will automatically 
  update your classpath.</p>

</p>
<p align="left"> Note that the order of the plug-ins in the list is important 
  because it dictates the classloading order at runtime, so use the <strong>Up</strong> 
  and <strong>Down</strong> buttons to organize the list as appropriate.</p>
<p align="left">A plug-in listed in the <strong>Required Plug-ins</strong> section 
  can be marked as re-exported in its Properties dialog.&nbsp; Re-exporting a 
  dependency means that clients of your plug-in will get that dependency for free.&nbsp; 
  It is important that you do not abuse this functionality and use it only when 
  it makes sense to do so.</p>
<p align="left">If your plug-in requires a specific version of a plug-in to function 
  properly, then you can specify the version required along with the version match 
  rule.&nbsp; You can read more about valid values in the Platform ISV guide.</p>
<p align="left">The Eclipse runtime gives the flexibility to declare a dependency 
  on a package without explicitly identifying its originating plug-in. These packages 
  are listed in the <strong>Imported Packages</strong> section.</p>
<p align="left">The <b>Dependency Analysis</b> contain several useful features 
such as finding cycles in the dependency graph.&nbsp; Such cycles are forbidden 
by the runtime, making the analysis useful for performing a sanity check on your plug-in's 
dependency graph before testing it.</p>
<p align="left">For a selected plug-in in the list, <b>Compute Dependency Extent</b> 
will give you a list of all the Java types and all the extension points that 
your plug-in needs from that dependency.&nbsp; So, in essence, it tells you why 
you need that plug-in.</p>
<p align="left">Since the JARs from all the plug-ins in the list of dependencies 
will be on your plug-in's classpath at runtime, it is very important to not have 
any dependencies that you do not need, as they would slow down classloading.&nbsp; 
To find such extraneous entries and remove them, use the <b>Find Unused 
Dependencies</b> feature available on this page.</p>
