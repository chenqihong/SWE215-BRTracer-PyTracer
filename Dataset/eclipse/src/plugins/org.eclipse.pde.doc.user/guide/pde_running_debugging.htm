<h2>Running under debug</h2>
<p>The same Runtime Workbench launcher can be used for debugging. There is no
special PDE support for debugging beyond the standard Java debugging support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press the <b>Debug</b> tool bar button instead of <b>Run</b> in
order to debug your plug-in. You can place breakpoints in
your Java code and step through the source once you reach them.&nbsp;</p>
<p> PDE ensures that
there is no difference between workspace and external plug-ins when
debugging.&nbsp; You can jump from class to class without knowing whether you are looking at the
read-only source attached to external libraries or editable source in your
workspace. For more information about debugging, see the JDT User Guide.</p>
<p>If your target platform is not the same as the host and the target platform
is a product that does not contain source code, you will not be able to step
through source when the control moves into the platform classes. Some
platform-based products may elect to ship without source and offer source as
part of the product SDK. In that case, source code will be installed separately
(usually later). Source code is delivered via plug-ins that contain ZIP files
and plug into the PDE extension point for registering source code locations.
When associating run-time libraries and source attachments, PDE will scan the
available source code locations trying to find the matching source ZIP.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can download source code onto your disk drive and register
the location manually using PDE preference page:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/source-locations.png" alt="PDE Preferences - Source Code Locations" ></p>
<p align="left">You will notice that some locations already exist if the host
instance is the SDK itself and contains source plug-ins. You can add new
locations by selecting <b>Add...</b> and choosing a valid local directory.</p>
