<h2>Setting up a feature project</h2>
<p>Similar to plug-ins and fragments, PDE treats platform features as projects.
PDE attaches a special &quot;feature&quot; capability to these projects to be
able to run nature-specific builders. The project must have a feature manifest.</p>
<p>PDE provides a wizard for setting up a feature project. Typically, you use
this wizard to set up a feature once you are done developing plug-ins and
fragments. However, you can create the feature at any stage of development and
add new plug-ins later.</p>
<h3>Example: Setting up a feature for plug-ins and fragments</h3>
<p>Assuming that you have followed the previous examples, you should have &quot;XYZ
Plug-in&quot; and &quot;German Fragment&quot; in your workspace already.&nbsp; We will
create a sample feature and package these artifacts to be ready for delivery.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Bring up the feature wizard (<b>New-&gt;Project-&gt;Plug-in
    Development-&gt;Feature
    Project</b>)</li>
  <li>Set the name of the project to &quot;com.example.feature&quot; and press <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>Set the feature name to &quot;Sample Feature&quot;&nbsp; and the feature version to &quot;1.2.2&quot;. Set the provider to
    &quot;Example&quot;.</li>
  <li>In the following page, check the plug-in (XYZ Plug-in) and the fragment
    (German Fragment).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Press <b>Finish</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have the &quot;com.example.feature&quot; project in your workspace.&nbsp;
The project should have <br>
&quot;feature.xml&quot; file and feature manifest editor will open for editing.</p>
