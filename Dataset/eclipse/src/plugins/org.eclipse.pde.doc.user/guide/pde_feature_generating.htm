<h2>Exporting a Feature</h2>

<p>First you have to set up the build configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp; The build 
configuration includes information about the files and directories that should 
be included in the feature for each individual plug-in and fragment.&nbsp; There 
may be some design-time files and directories that should not be shipped.&nbsp; 
See <a href="pde_feature_generating_build.htm">Build Configuration</a> for 
details.</p>

Then you can use PDE's Export Deployable Features wizard to build and export the 
feature.&nbsp; This way you are shielded from Ant scripts and your workspace is 
never polluted with build by-products. 
<p>Select <b>File &gt; Export... &gt; Deployable Features</b>.</p>
<p>Select the feature(s) you want to export. </p>
<p>A feature can be exported to an archive or a directory.</p>
<p>To publish a feature to an update site, the feature and its includes plug-ins 
  must be packaged as individual JAR archives.</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="images/feature-export.png" alt="Export Features wizard" ></p>
<p align="left">Press <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/jnlp.PNG" alt="JNLP manifest generation"></p>
<p>You have the option to sign the JARs for added security. You also have the 
  option to generate JNLP manifests for <a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/java_web_start.htm">Java 
  Web Start deployment</a>.</p>
<p>The wizard will build all the features selected and their included plug-ins 
  and fragments.&nbsp; Features go into a features/ subdirectory and plug-ins 
  go into a plugins/ subdirectory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alternative would be to build features manually:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click on the feature.xml file for your feature project and choose '<b>Create 
  Ant Build File</b>'.&nbsp; This will generate a build.xml file.</li>
  <li>Select the build.xml file and choose '<b>Run Ant...</b>'&nbsp; </li>
  <li>In the Ant build script wizard, select the target(s) you want to run.&nbsp; 
  See <a href="pde_feature_generating_ant.htm">Generating Ant Scripts</a> for 
  details.</li>
</ol>
