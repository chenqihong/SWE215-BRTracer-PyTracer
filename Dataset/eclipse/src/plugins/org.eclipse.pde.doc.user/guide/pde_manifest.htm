<h1>Plug-in manifest editor</h1>
<p>When the plug-in project is created, the manifest file is open in the plug-in 
manifest editor.</p>
<p>This multi-page editor is the central place to manage your plug-in and can 
  be used to edit all the plug-in's file (manifest.mf , plugin.xml and build.properties).</p>
<p>When you use the editor's forms, PDE transparently handles the task of 
writing the changes to the right files.</p>
<p>The best way to learn about the plug-in manifest editor is to visit each
page.</p>
