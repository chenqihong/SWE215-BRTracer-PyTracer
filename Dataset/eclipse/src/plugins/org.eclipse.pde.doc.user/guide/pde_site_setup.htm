<h2>Setting up an update site project</h2>
<p>An update site project is represented in the workspace with a project that 
has a site.xml file at its root.</p>
<p>PDE provides a wizard for setting up an update site project. Typically, you use
this wizard to set up an update site once you are done developing plug-ins,
fragments and features. However, you can create the site project at any stage of development.</p>
<p>By default, an update site project is created local to your workspace. Since you 
may want to host multiple versions of your plug-ins and features in this site, 
you may want to keep the update site outside the workspace location. In that 
case, change the location of the update site project during creation. If the 
location you specified already contains the files the wizard is about to create, 
it will keep them instead. This will allow you to create this project in more 
than one workspace and point at the same shared location.</p>
<h3>Example: Setting up an update site project</h3>
<p>Assuming that you have followed the previous examples, you should have &quot;XYZ
Plug-in&quot; and &quot;German Fragment&quot; in your workspace already, as well 
as &quot;Sample Feature&quot; feature project.&nbsp; We will
create an update site that can serve &quot;Sample Feature&quot; to the update manager.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Bring up the update site wizard via <b>New &gt; Project &gt; Plug-in
    Development &gt; Update Site
    Project</b>.</li>
  <li>Set the name of the project to &quot;Update Site&quot;. </li>
  <li>Set the update location to a non-default location.</li>
  <li>Select the <b>Generate a web page</b> listing option.&nbsp; This will help 
  advertise your features and plug-ins to the world.&nbsp; Click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
</ol>
