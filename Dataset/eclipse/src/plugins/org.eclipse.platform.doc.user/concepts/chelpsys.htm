<h1>Help system</h1>

<p>The online help system lets you 
browse, search, and print system documentation. The documentation is organized
  into sets of  information that are analogous to books. The help system also
  supplies a text
search capabilities for finding the information you need by keyword and
context-sensitive help for finding information to describe the particular
function you are working with.</p>
<p>You can interact with help system in the workbench using Help view, or in
  external help browser window.</p>
<h2>The help browser</h2>

<p>When you first open the help browser by selecting <b>Help &gt; Help Contents</b> 
in the Workbench, the first view shown in the help window is called Contents.
   Contents displays 
various groupings of documentation for the product. Click on 
one of the links to expand the navigation tree for that set of documentation.
Browse the tree and click on topics to display them.</p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p>If you want to find a particular piece of information in the online help, use
Search. The help system will search the entire information set, or only a part
of it, to find topics that meet the criteria you specify.</p>

<h2>The Help view</h2>

<p>You can open a Help view by The Help view
  by selecting <b>Help &gt; Dynamic Help</b> or by selecting <b>Help &gt; Search </b>
in the Workbench., A help view will open turning to the Related Topics or to the
Search page. You can use links at the bottom of the help view to turn to other
pages. Browse topics and click on links to display them.</p>

<h2>Context-sensitive help</h2>

<p>If you are working through a task and encounter part of the interface that
you do not understand, use context-sensitive help.. Bring focus to the
  interface widget in
question by clicking on it or using the Tab key, and then press <code>F1</code>
(<code>Ctrl+F1</code> on GTK+, and <code>Help</code> key on Carbon). A Help view
will display description of the widget in focus, and list related topics. Leave
the Help view open to see information on other interface elements when you focus
on them.</p>
<p>When working in a dialog, like wizards, or preferences, and request context-sensitive
  help, a help view will be shown in a small window adjacent to the dialog.</p>
<p>An alternative way of presenting context-sensitive information are infopops.
  You can use help preference page to choose to use infopops instead of Help
  view for displaying context-sensitive help. If configured, a context help key,
  such as <code>F1</code>, will open an infopop that will provide you with information
  about the interface and, if appropriate, links
  to more
  information.</p>
<p>Note: On the some installation of KDE, Ctrl+F1 is the key binding for "Switch
to Desktop 1".  To make context-sensitive help work with GTK+ on KDE, then that
binding must be removed.  Try using the "KDE Default for 4 Modifier Keys" key
binding scheme.</p>
