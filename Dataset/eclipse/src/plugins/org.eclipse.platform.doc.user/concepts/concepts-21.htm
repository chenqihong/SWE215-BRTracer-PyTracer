Fast views</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
   Fast views are hidden views that can be quickly opened and closed. They work
   like other views except they do not take up space in your Workbench window.&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type> Fast views are represented by toolbar buttons on the 
  <i>fast view bar</i>, which is the horizontal toolbar initially on the bottom 
  left of the Workbench window. When you click the toolbar button for a fast view, 
  that view opens temporarily in the current perspective. As soon as you click 
  outside that view, it is hidden again. The fast view bar can also be docked 
  on the right and left side of the Workbench window.</P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
You can create a new fast view by dragging any open view to the
shortcut bar or by selecting <b>Fast View</b> from the menu that opens when you
click the icon at the left end of the view's title bar.</p>
