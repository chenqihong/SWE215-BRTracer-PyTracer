<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>Sometimes you may need to use an external program to
edit a file in the Workbench. This can occur, for example, when the Workbench
has no editor for that file type.</P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>The external program will be used if that program is
registered as the system default editor for that file type and no other editor
is registered for that file type in the Workbench. For example, on most systems the default
&quot;editor&quot; for HTML files is a Web browser. If there is no other editor
associated with .htm and .html files in the Workbench, then opening an HTML file from the
Workbench would cause the file to be opened in a separate browser session.</P>
