<h2>Activities</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">Activities, also referred to as Capabilities, are plug-ins logically 
  grouped to provide functionality and improve scalability. Welcome page selections 
  determine what activities are enabled, but activities can also later be enabled 
  or disabled using the preference page. When an activity is enabled, the actions 
  associated with that activity are available to the user, however once an activity 
  is disabled those actions are no longer visible in menus, wizards and so on. 
  Should the user attempt to employ an action that has been disabled a prompt 
  will appear confirming the enablement of the action, thus providing new functions 
  to the Workbench as they are required by the user. </P>
