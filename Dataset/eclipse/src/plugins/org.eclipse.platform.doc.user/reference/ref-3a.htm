<P class="Intro"> The fast view bar is the place where fast views are docked. 
  It may be docked in three locations. It may be docked on the left, bottom (default) 
  and right. </p>
<p>Here is an example of what some fast view bars look like:&nbsp;</P>

<DIV CLASS="Topic">
<h3>
View Buttons</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">
These buttons provide a quick way to display the
fast views in the current perspective.&nbsp; Fast views are essentially
minimized views that have been dragged onto the shortcut bar.&nbsp; Fast views
pop up when selected, and revert
back to their minimized state when the user clicks outside of the view and may be oriented either horizontally or vertically according to their configuration.&nbsp; 
To convert a fast view back into a normal view, click on the <i>Fast View</i> action
in the view's menu or drag it back to the workbench.&nbsp;</P>
