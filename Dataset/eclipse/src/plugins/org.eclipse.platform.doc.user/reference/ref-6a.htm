Local history</H1>
<p>Local history of a file is maintained when you create or modify a file. Each time you edit and save
a file,&nbsp;a copy of it is saved. This allows you to compare
your current file state to a previous state, or replace the file with a previous
state.&nbsp;Each state in the local
history is identified by the date and time the file was
saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither projects nor folders have local history.</p>
<p>Here is a look at what the local history of a Workbench file might look
like:</p>
<p><img src="../images/Image273_local_hist.png" alt="Local history dialog" border="0" ></p>
<P>To view the local history of a file, choose Team &gt; Compare with &gt; Local History... from the pop-up
menu.&nbsp;You can select different local states in the list, which are compared against the
current file. You can also revert to the local history when you select a file and
select the Team &gt; Replace With &gt; Local History... menu item.&nbsp;&nbsp;
