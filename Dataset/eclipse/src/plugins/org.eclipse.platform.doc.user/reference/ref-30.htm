<P>This view displays an outline of a structured file
that is currently open in the editor area, and&nbsp; lists structural
elements.&nbsp;The contents of the outline view are editor-specific. In the
example below, which is for a Java source file, the structural elements are classes, variables, and methods.
The contents of the toolbar are also editor-specific.
