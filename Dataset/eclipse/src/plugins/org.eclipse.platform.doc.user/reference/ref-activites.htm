<h2>Activities Editor Pages</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">The activities editor consists of three pages, the Viewers Page, 
  the Descriptions Page and the &quot;activities.xml&quot; Page.</P>
<P CLASS="Para"> <strong>Viewers Page</strong></P>
<P CLASS="Para">The viewers page has two separate viewers, one viewer is for the 
  plug-ins and fragments, and the other viewer is for the categories and activities, 
  as well as plug-ins and fragments. </P>
<P CLASS="Para">The first viewer displays all the plug-ins and fragments located 
  in Eclipse's workspace directory. The second viewer displays the categories, 
  the activities bound to categories and the plug-ins bound to activities. The 
  latter items are also initially read from Eclipse's workspace directory. <br>
</P>

<p><strong>Descriptions Page</strong></p>
<p> Categories and activities are defined by mandatory IDs, names and optional 
  descriptions. The descriptions page has two viewers, one which allows for the 
  modification of categories' descriptions and the other of activities' descriptions. 
</p>
<p>The first viewer displays the categories, their respective ID, name and the 
  editable description field. The second viewer shows the same information for 
  the current activities. When the editor switches to another page, the descriptions 
  are then updated in the &quot;activities.xml&quot; file. <br>
</p>
<p><img src="../images/description.png" alt="Image of Descriptions page" border="0" ></p>

<p><strong>&quot;activities.xml&quot; Page</strong></p>
<p> When the &quot;activities.xml&quot; page tab is clicked it updates automatically. 
  The file will contain the category, activity, and binding definitions represented 
  in the viewers' page. </p>
<p><img src="../images/xml.png" alt="Image of activities.xml page" border="0" ></p>

<p><strong>Generated Format </strong> </p>
<p>Activity pattern bindings are created when plug-ins are added to an activity. 
  The patterns follow a syntax similar to the following example: &quot;org\.eclipse\.pde/.*&quot; 
  for the plug-in &quot;org.eclipse.pde&quot;. If all the plug-ins starting with 
  &quot;org.eclipse.pde&quot; have been added to the same activity, the individual 
  plug-ins patterns are replaced with &quot;org\.eclipse\.pde\..*/.*&quot;. Similarly, 
  on removal of a plug-in from an activity where the latter pattern is defined, 
  the pattern will be replaced by the patterns of the plug-ins remaining in that 
  activity. The activity editor will read activity pattern bindings on start up 
  from defined &quot;org.eclipse.activities&quot; extensions defined in other 
  plug-ins if and only if they follow the syntax described above.</P>
<p>A unique ID is generated when an activity is created. The ID has the following 
  format: &quot;activityName&quot; + Activity, where the activity name has been 
  stripped from spaces, and converted to lower case. A unique ID is generated 
  when a category is created. The ID will have the following format: &quot;categoryName&quot; 
  + Category, where the category name has been stripped from spaces, and converted 
  to lower case. </P>
