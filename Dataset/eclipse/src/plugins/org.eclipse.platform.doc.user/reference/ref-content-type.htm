<P CLASS="Para"> The Content Types preference page allows you to edit content 
  types, their associated file names and character sets as well as associate arbitrary 
  file names or file extensions with content types. A content type acts as a description 
  of a certain class of files (for instance, XML files). Eclipse uses this description 
  in various scenarios such as editor look up and file comparing. </P>
<P CLASS="Para">To access the Content Types preference page select <strong>Window 
  &gt; Preferences &gt; General > Content Types</strong>. Here is what the Content 
  Types preference page looks like:&nbsp; </P>

<p CLASS="Para">By selecting a content type in the topmost tree you can alter 
  the file names and extensions that are associated with it. <strong>Note</strong>: 
  Certain items will be marked as "locked". An item is locked if it is one of 
  the associations provided by the plug-in that declares the content type. In 
  other words, only user-contributed associations may be removed.</P>
<p CLASS="Para">Adding an association is as simple as clicking <strong>Add...</strong>. 
  A dialog will be shown prompting you to enter the file name or extension.</P>

<p CLASS="Para">In addition to adding and removing file names or extensions, you 
  may also set the default character set for a given content type. To do this, 
  simply enter the character set name in the provided field and click <strong>Update</strong>.
