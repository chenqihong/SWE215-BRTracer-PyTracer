<p CLASS="Para">The Preferences dialog is the dialog used to set user preferences. 
  The Preferences dialog pages can be searched using the filter function. To filter 
  by matching the page title, simply type the name of the page you are seeking 
  and the available pages will be presented below. The filter also searches on 
  keywords such as appearance and java. The history controls allow you to navigate 
  through previously viewed pages. To step back or forward several pages at a 
  time, click the drop down arrow and a list of the most recently viewed preference 
  pages will appear.</p> 
<p CLASS="Para">The Preferences dialog can be found from the main workbench <b>Window</b> 
  menu under <b>Window &gt; Preferences</b>. Preference pages contributed by plug-ins 
  will be found in this dialog.</p>
