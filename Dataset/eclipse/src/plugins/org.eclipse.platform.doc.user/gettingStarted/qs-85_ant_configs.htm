<h3>Saving &amp; Reusing Ant options</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para">When we ran the HelloWorld.xml Ant buildfile in the last section, 
  the choice of targets, along with all other options in the Run Ant dialog were 
  saved in an entity called a 'launch configuration'. Launch configurations contain 
  all details necessary to run a single Ant buildfile in a particular way. It is 
  perfectly valid to have multiple launch configurations associated with a single 
  Ant buildfile. So, in addition to the launch configuration that was created in 
  the last step, specifying that our HelloWorld.xml buildfile should execute the 
  targets Hello &amp; World in that order, we could create a second launch configuration 
  for this same buildfile specifying the same targets but in the reverse order. So 
  far so good. But the really nice thing about launch configurations is that now 
  you can quickly run your Ant buildfile in either configuration by simply specifying 
  the corresponding launch configuration.</P>
<ol>
  <li>From the Workbench toolbar, select <b>Run &gt; External Tools &gt; External Tools...</b>.</li>
  <li>The External Tools dialog opens and presents a choice of launch configurations 
    to view and edit. The launch configuration we created when we ran the HelloWorld.xml 
    buildfile is selected in the tree at the left, and the tabs on the right show 
    the options for this launch configuration.<br>

  </li>
  <li>At the top of the dialog, change the Name to 'Hello World' and <b>Apply</b> 
    the change.</li>
  <li>In the tree at left, bring up on the context menu on the selected launch 
    configuration and choose <b>Duplicate</b>. A copy of the launch configuration 
    for the Hello World buildfile is created, '(1)' is appended to the name, and 
    the new launch configuration is selected in the tree.</li>
  <li>Rename the new configuration to 'World Hello'.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Targets</b> tab, click the <b>Order...</b> button, change the 
    order of the targets so that the World target executes first, and <b>Apply</b> 
    the change.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Run</b>.</li>
  <li>As before, the HelloWorld.xml buildfile runs and sends its output to the 
    Console view. This time however, because the targets were reversed, the output 
    is reversed as well.</li>
  <li>Go back to the External Tools drop down in the toolbar. <br>
    <img src="../images/et_dropdown.png" alt="External tools drop-down menu" border="0" ><br>
    Notice now that there are two entries in the history, one for Hello World 
    and one for World Hello. In order to rerun the Ant buildfile so that it outputs 
    Hello World, just select this launch configuration in the history. To rerun 
    the launch configuration that outputs World Hello, select this configuration 
    in the history.<br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: The history is ordered so that the most frequently 
    run configurations are at the top of the dropdown.</li>
</ol>
<p>This concludes our quick look at the basics of Ant integration in Eclipse. 
  In the next chapters, we consider several real-world use cases for running Ant 
  buildfiles inside Eclipse.</p>
