Rearranging views</h3>
<p CLASS="Head"> The position of the Navigator view in the Workbench window can 
  be changed.</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Head"> Click in the title bar of the Navigator view and drag the 
      view across the Workbench window. Do not release the mouse button yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Head"> While still dragging the view around on top of the Workbench 
      window, note that various drop cursors appear. These drop cursors (see previous 
      section) indicate where the view will dock in relation to the view or editor 
      area underneath the cursor when the mouse button is released. Notice also that
      a rectangular highlight is drawn that provides additional feedback on where the
      view will dock.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Dock the view in any position in the Workbench window, and 
      view the results of this action. </P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Click and drag the view's title bar to re-dock the view in 
      another position in the Workbench window. Observe the results of this action. 
    </P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Finally, drag the Navigator view over the Outline view. A 
      stack cursor will be displayed. If the mouse button is released the Navigator 
      will be stacked with the Outline view into a tabbed notebook.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </P>
