<h3>The Search view&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Now that the search for &quot;it&quot; has been completed, the Search view 
  is visible. The title of the Search view shows that four matches were found.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <img src="../images/Image51_search_view.png"  alt="Search view. Four occurrences of the word it found in the Workspace." border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p CLASS="Head"> Within the Search view two files are shown and within each file 
  there were 2 matches found.&nbsp; </p>
    <ol>
  <li>Click the Show Next Match button <img src="../images/Image51_search_next.png"  alt="Show next match button" border="0">to 
    navigate to the first match of the search expression (&quot;it&quot;). <br>
    Notice that the file JanesFile.txt is automatically selected and opened in 
    the editor area. <br>
    Click Show Next Match button two more times. Once again the Search view automatically 
    opens the file (JanesText.txt).</li>
  <li>It is sometimes useful to remove uninteresting matches from the search results. 
    The Search view's popup menu allows you to do this using <b>Remove Selected 
    Matches</b> which removes any selected file entries (and all matches in them) 
    from the Search view. Note that this <strong>only</strong> removes the entries 
    in the Search view, it does <strong>not</strong> effect the files themselves. 
    Select JanesFile.txt and choose <b>Remove Selected Matches</b> from the popup 
    menu. The Search view now shows only the matches for JanesText.txt 
    <blockquote><img src="../images/Image51_search_reduced.png"  alt="Search view. One occurrence in Workspace." border="0"></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Perform a second search for &quot;that&quot; by clicking on the Search button 
    <img src="../images/Image50_search.png"  alt="Search button" border="0"> in 
    the Workbench's toolbar.</li>
  <li><p>The Search view updates to show the results of the new search. <br>
    Use the drop down button on the Search view's toolbar to move back and forth 
    between the two search results. 
    <blockquote><img src="../images/Image51_search_switching.png"  alt="Search view. Drop down button." border="0"></blockquote></p>
  </li>
  <li>In the drop down button choose &quot;it&quot; - 1 Occurrence. The Search 
    view switches back to show the original search. On the context menu choose 
    <b>Search Again</b> to repeat the initial search. Notice that once again there 
    are four matches.</li>
</ol>
