<h2>
The Workbench</h2>
<P CLASS="Para"> When the Workbench is launched the first thing you see is a 
  dialog that allows you to select where the workspace should be located. The
  workspace is the directory where your work will be stored. For now, just
  click OK to pick the default location. (You can also check the checkbox
  to prevent this question from being asked again.)</p>
 <p>After the workspace location is chosen, a single Workbench window is displayed. 
  A Workbench window offers one or more perspectives. A perspective contains 
  editors and views, such as the Navigator. Multiple Workbench windows can be 
  opened simultaneously. Initially, in the first Workbench window that is opened,
  the Resource perspective is displayed, with only the Welcome view visible. 
  Click the arrow labeled <b>Workbench</b> in the Welcome view to cause the other
  views in the perspective to become visible.</P>
<p>(You can get the Welcome view back at any time by selecting
  <b>Help > Welcome</b>.)</p>
<p>A shortcut bar appears in the top right corner of the window. This allows the user 
  to open new perspectives and switch between ones already open. The name of the 
  active perspective is shown in the title of the window and its item in the shortcut 
  bar is highlighted.</p>
<p>The title bar of the Workbench window indicates which perspective is active. 
  In this example, the Resource perspective is in use. The Navigator, Tasks, and 
  Outline views are open along with an editor. <br>
