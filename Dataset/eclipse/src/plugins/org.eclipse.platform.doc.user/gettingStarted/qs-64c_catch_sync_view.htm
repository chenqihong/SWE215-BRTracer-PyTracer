<h3>Working with conflicting changes<br>
</h3>
<p class="Para">There are cases where two users are editing the same files and 
  when the second to commit to the repository tries to commit their changes, the 
  repository won't allow the commit to succeed because of the conflict. Let's 
  simulate this by making Fred and Jane change the same files.<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In Fred's workspace open one of the navigation views and edit file1.txt. Make
the text the following:<br>
    <br style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Fred line 1</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">This is the contents</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Fred-update</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">of file 1.<br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>Fred will also change
file2.txt with the following change:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">File2 is a (Fred was here again)
small file</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">with simple text.</span><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Fred committed his changes to the repository.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Next, at the same time Jane was making changes to file1.txt. She
added the following line to the end of the file:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">This is the contents</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Fred-update</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">of file 1.</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Jane was at the end<br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li>And finally, Jane changed file2.txt to the following:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">File2 is a (Jane was here) small
file</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">with simple text.<br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li>When Jane was finished making changes she synchronized the
project and found the following appear in the Synchronize View:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="../images/Image83_jane3_conflict.png">
<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Both file1.txt and file2.txt show with a red icon indicating that they have 
    conflicting changes. You can't commit the files until the conflicts are resolved. 
    Click on file1.txt and notice that Fred and Jane made changes to two different 
    parts of the file. In this case, Jane can simply update the file and the lines 
    added by Fred will be merged into Jane's local file. Select file1.txt and 
    from the context menu select <strong>Update</strong>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Next, double on file2.txt to see the conflict. In this case you can see 
    that both Jane and Fred changed the same line. For this type of conflicting 
    change a regular update can't resolve the conflict. Here you have three options 
    (with the command to use in brackets): accept the changes from Fred (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Override 
    and Update</span>), ignore Fred's changes (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mark 
    as Merged</span>), or manually merge the files within the compare editor.<br>
    <br>

<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>For this example, let's say Jane updated file1.txt and selected
override and update for file2.txt. After the operations are run the
conflicts turn into outgoing changes. Jane can review the changes and
commit them.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
