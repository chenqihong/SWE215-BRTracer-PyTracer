<h3> Updating</h3>
<p CLASS="Para"> The Synchronize view will be used to update the local resource 
  to the latest contents in the repository and to commit any changes.</p>
<p CLASS="Para">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Confirm that the Synchronize view is in Incoming Mode (#1). If it is not 
    then press the Incoming Mode button on the local toolbar (#2). 
    <p><img src="../images/Image83_jane5a.png" alt="Incoming mode" border="0" ></p>
  </li>
  <li>Open file1.txt (the incoming change) by double-clicking. The comparison 
    viewer shows that&nbsp;the repository copy of file1.txt has a new line inserted 
    (Fred-update). 
    <p><img src="../images/Image83_jane4.png" alt="Text Compare" border="0" ></p></li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para"> From the context menu of file1.txt choose <b>Update</b>. 
      This will cause the Workbench to be updated with the repository copy of 
      file1.txt. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Select file2.txt. The comparison viewer shows that&nbsp;the repository copy 
    of file1.txt and the local copy of file1.txt have both had the exact same 
    line modified.&nbsp; 
    <p><img src="../images/Image83_jane6a.png" alt="Text Compare" border="0" ></p></li>
  <li>If the change seems suspicious, find out some more information about it. 
    To do this, first figure out who made the change and why. 
    <p>In the Structure compare pane of the Synchronize view select file2.txt 
      and choose <b>Show in Resource History</b> from the context menu.</p>
    <p><img src="../images/Image84_reshist.png" alt="Resource History" border="0" ></p>
  </li>
  <li>In the Resource History view (see above) there is a * next to version 1.1. 
    This indicates 1.1 is currently in the Workbench. It also shows that the repository 
    contains 1.2 of file2.txt.&nbsp;The author of 1.2 is Fred. Looks like it's 
    time to ask Fred why he was changing file2.txt.&nbsp; 
    <p>If Fred had entered a meaningful description when releasing his changes, 
      these descriptions would have appeared in the comment field of the Resource 
      History view thereby providing some insight into the intent of the change.</p> 
  </li>
  <li>The four copy buttons can now be used to help merge in conflicting changes 
    made to the repository. 
    <p> For now assume that Fred's change turns out to be the right one.</p> 
    <p>Select file2.txt and choose <b>Override and Update</b> from the context 
      menu. When asked to confirm the replacement choose <b>Yes</b>.</p> </li>
  <li>The Update mode no longer has any remaining incoming or conflicting changes.&nbsp; 
    <p>The status bar shows that there is still one remaining outgoing change 
      to deal with.</p>
