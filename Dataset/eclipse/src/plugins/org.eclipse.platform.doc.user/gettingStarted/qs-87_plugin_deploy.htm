<h3>Deploying Eclipse plug-ins</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para">The first use of Ant within Eclipse discussed here will be as 
  a plug-in deployment tool. When developing Eclipse plug-ins, it's frequently 
  handy to build the jar files for your plug-in and test them as part of an Eclipse 
  install. The Ant buildfile we'll look at in the next section will do this and 
  much more.</P>
