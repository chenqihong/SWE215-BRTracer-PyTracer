<h3>
Making our own changes</h3>
<p class="Para">Fred has made several changes to file1.txt and
file2.txt and committed them to the repository. In this section
additional changes will be made and then synchronized with the
repository. When synchronizing, expect to see the changes made in this
section along with changes that have been made by Fred.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add file3.txt as follows 
    <p>New contents:(changes shown in bold)</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><i>This is the brief contents<br>
        of file<b> </b>3</i></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Observe that the Navigator displays the CVS state of a resources. Notice 
    that the new file added by Jane is preceded by "&gt;". 
    <blockquote> 
      <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image83_jane1.png" alt="Navigator View">
</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p class="Para">Select the project <span style="font-weight: bold;">JanesTeamProject</span> 
      and from the project's context menu, select <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with 
      Repository</b>. When asked to switch perspective select <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Yes</span>. The Team Synchronizing perspective will 
      open and you will see the files you have changed appear in the Synchronize 
      View. Double click on file1.txt and you should see a compare editor open:</p>
	  <p class="Para"><img src="../images/Image83_jane-sync.png"></p>
  </li>
  <li>There are a couple of other things worth observing. First, the icon next 
    to file1.txt (in the structured compare area) indicates that file1.txt has 
    an incoming change. This means a change was released to the server which you 
    need to take. Looking at file1.txt we can see the text that Fred has added 
    to the file. Also, notice at the bottom of the window, in the status line, 
    there are arrows with numbers beside them. These show the number of files 
    you have incoming, outgoing, and in conflict. The first number beside a file 
    is the revision you have in the workspace, and the other is the revision on 
    the server when you last synchronized.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Normally you should update the changes made by others, then test your workspace 
    with the changes, then commit your changes once you are sure that the new 
    changes by others didn't break anything in your workspace. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Before deciding to accept Fred's changes you may want to find out why he 
    made the changes. Select file1.txt and from the context menu select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Show 
    in Resource History</span>.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="../images/Image83_jane-history.png" > <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The row starting with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">*</span> indicates 
    that this is the current revision loaded. In this case you can see the comment 
    made by Fred when he released revision 1.2. <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Trick</span>: You can select the 'link with 
    editor' toolbar button in the history view to have the history automatically 
    update when a new editor is opened. This allows for quick browsing of comments.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>To update simply select <span style="font-weight: bold;">JanesTeamProject</span> 
    in the Synchronize View and from the context menu select <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Synchronize View will update to reflect the fact that file1.txt and 
    file2.txt are no longer out-of-sync with the repository. You should only have 
    file3.txt visible now.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Next you can commit file3.txt.<br>
    <p><br>
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
