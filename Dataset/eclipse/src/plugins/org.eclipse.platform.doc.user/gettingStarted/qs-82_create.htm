<h3>Creating Ant buildfiles</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para"> Ant buildfiles are just text files, so the most straightforward 
  way to create an Ant buildfile in Eclipse is:</P>
<ol>
  <li><b>File &gt; New &gt; File</b>.</li>
  <li>Enter any name for the file, but make sure it has a .xml extension.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as the file has a .xml extension, Eclipse will consider it to be a 
  possible Ant buildfile, and will enable Ant-related actions when it is selected.
  Until a file has ant buildfile content, you will need to open it using <b>Open With &gt; Ant Editor</b>.</p>
<p>As will be demonstrated in a later section, an Ant buildfile can be created 
  for an Eclipse plug-in that contains predefined targets related useful for deploying 
  the plug-in.</p>
