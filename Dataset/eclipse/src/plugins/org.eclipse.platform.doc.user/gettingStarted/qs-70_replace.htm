<h3> Replacing</h3>
<p class="Head">Suppose after further reflection, it becomes apparent
that the revision of file1.txt that was just received is incorrect and
an earlier revision is required. A Workbench resource can be replaced
with an earlier revision of the resource from the repository. To roll
back to an earlier revision:</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p class="Head"> In one of the navigation views select the file1.txt.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p class="Para"> From the file's context menu, select <b>Replace With &gt; 
      Revision.<br>
      <br>
      </b></p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p class="Para"> In the replace with revision Compare editor that opens, choose 
      the original (bottom) revision and, from the pop-up menu choose <b>Get Contents</b>.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>Observe that the navigation view updates to show the CVS state of a resource. 
      Notice that the modified file is preceded by "&gt;" (see #1) indicating 
      that file1.txt has changed (by replacing it with the earlier version). <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="../images/Image84_replace2.png"  alt="File selection"> <br>
      <br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Now assume that this older revision is not as good as it initially seemed 
    and in fact the revision in the repository is better after all.&nbsp; 
    <p>Instead of choosing <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b>, choose 
      <b>Replace With &gt; Latest from Repository.</b></p>
    <p>Observe that file1.txt is updated to be the contents from the repository, 
      and that the leading indicator "&gt;" has been removed since it is now the 
      same revision as the repository. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Now that how to synchronize with the repository, replace with a revision or 
  replace with the latest from the repository has been explained, these revisions/versions 
  can also be compared with in a similar manner by choosing the <b>Compare With</b> 
  menu operation from a resource's context menu in the navigation view. </p>
