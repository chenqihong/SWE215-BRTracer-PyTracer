<H1 CLASS="Head">Finding a resource quickly</H1>

<P>To navigate to a particular resource in a view such as the Navigator view: 
</P>

<ol>
  <li>From <b>Navigate</b> menu, select <b>Go To &gt; Resource</b>.</li>
  <li>In the window that opens, start typing the name of the
    resource in the <b>Pattern</b> field. As you type the file name, the system
    offers a list of possible matches, based on what you have entered so far.</li>
  <li>Select the resource that you want from the <b>Matching
    Resources</b> list, and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The view displays the selected resource.</p>
<p>
If you want to open a particular resource in an editor rather than select
it in a view, you can use the <b>Navigate &gt; Open Resource</b> action.
This action presents the same dialog as the <b>Go To &gt; Resource</b> action,
but immediately opens the matching resource for editing.
</p>
<p>You can also do a contextual search for character strings contained within 
  files in the Workbench. See the links to related tasks below. </p>
