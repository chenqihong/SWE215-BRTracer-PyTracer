<h1>Restoring a saved configuration</h1>

<p>A previously saved configuration (or any configuration recorded in the history) 
  can be restored, thereby backing out of the results of an unsuccessful upgrade. 
  Restoring a saved configuration does not delete the files for feature and plug-in 
  versions from the local computer; it merely ignores them and acts as it did 
  when they were not present. To restore a saved configuration to be the current 
  configuration:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Select <b>Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; Manage Configuration...</b> to 
    open the Manage Configuration dialog. </li>
  <li>In the Product Configuration view, click the Installation History icon and 
    select the desired configuration. Click <b>Restore</b>.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Yes</b> when asked to exit and restart the Workbench for the changes 
    to take effect.</li>
  <li>Expand the Current Configuration (and children) to confirm that the current 
    configuration now matches the configuration saved earlier.</li>
</ol>
