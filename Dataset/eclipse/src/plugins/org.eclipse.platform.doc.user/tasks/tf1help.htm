<h1>Accessing context-sensitive help</h1>

<p>To access the context-sensitive help for a given widget:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the widget by putting focus on it (see the table below).</li>
  <li>Press <code>F1</code> key. On GTK windowing system use <code>Ctrl+F1</code>, and on
    Carbon windowing system use <code>Help</code> key instead of <code>F1</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This displays a description of the selected widget, 
and usually, a list of links to related information, in the help view. If you
  want more information than what is shown in the description, click a link to
one of the related topic, or one of the search results appearing in the dynamic
  help section in the help view.</p>
<p>Depending
    on help preference settings, requesting context-sensitive help may display
  context help in an <em>infopop</em> instead of help view. You can dismiss
  the 
infopop by clicking outside it, or by pressing <b>Esc</b>. If you want more information
than what is shown in the infopop, click a link to the related information. This
opens the Help browser to the selected topic and
closes the infopop. The list of related links stays in the left hand frame, 
so you do not have to press <code>F1</code> again if you are interested in other
topics related 
to the same widget.</p>
<p>To access context sensitive help for a widget, you must put focus on it and 
then press <code>F1</code>. The following table shows how to put focus on some of the different 
kinds of widgets.
</p>

<table border="1" width="500" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" summary="Widget selection table">
  <tr>
    <th>Widget type</th>
    <th>How to select it</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Menu item (for example <strong>Save</strong> in the <strong>File</strong> menu)</td>
    <td>Let your mouse pointer rest over it so that it is highlighted, but don't click on it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Field</td>
    <td>Put the cursor in the field.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Button (for example <b>Cancel</b> button on a Dialog)</td>
    <td>Tab until the button is in focus.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>List</td>
    <td>Click an item in the list.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>View or pane</td>
    <td>Click the title bar of the View or pane.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>checkbox</td>
    <td>Click the checkbox (which changes its state) or use the Tab key
      to bring it into focus.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><em>Note:</em> Context-sensitive help via <code>F1</code> is unavailable from toolbar
buttons. Instead, let your mouse pointer hover over a toolbar button to view tooltip help
for buttons.
