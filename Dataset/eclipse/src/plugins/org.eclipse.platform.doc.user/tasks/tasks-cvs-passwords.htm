<h1 class="Head">Password Management</h1>
<p>When creating a repository location, an option is provided at the bottom of 
  the wizard to save the password between sessions. <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><img src="../images/Image83_cvs_savedpasswords.png">
<br>
</p>
<p>In previous releases, passwords were automatically saved between sessions whereas 
  now the user has full control over this behavior. There is a caveat to this 
  though - the password file Eclipse uses to save the password between sessions 
  is not very secure. It is difficult, but not impossible, for an intruder to 
  read the file and find your passwords. </p>
<p>We recommend that, if you have strict security requirements, you <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">don't</span> save passwords using 
  this mechanism. Instead, use <a
 href="tasks-cvs-ssh2.htm">keypair authentication</a> provided by the <em>extssh</em> 
  connection method.</p>
<p>You can manage the list of passwords that have been cached via the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Team &gt; CVS &gt; Password Management</span> preference 
  page. The page displays the currently saved passwords and allows you to delete 
  them.</p>
