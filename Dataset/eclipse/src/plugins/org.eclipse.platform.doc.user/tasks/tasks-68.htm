<H1>Comparing resources</H1>

<p>When a comparison is performed, comparison 
editors appear in the editor area. The differences between files are highlighted
in the comparison editors, allowing you to browse and copy changes between the compared 
resources.
</p>

<p>To compare resources:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select one or more resources in one of the navigation views.</li>
  <li>From the resource's pop-up menu, select <b>Compare With.</b></li>
</ol>

<p>A tool for viewing differences is opened in the editor area.
</p>

<p>Here are some of the comparisons that you can perform.&nbsp;
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><b>Compare With &gt; Latest from HEAD</b></dt>
  <dd>compares the selected resource with the version of the same resource that 
    is currently committed to the active branch. This option is available for 
    CVS. This ,or a similar option, may or may not be available for other repository 
    types.</dd>
  <dt><b>Compare With &gt; Another Branch or Version</b></dt>
  <dd>compares the selected resource with a version that has been committed to 
    the repository or to the latest version in a particular branch. This requires 
    you to choose a version of the resource or a branch from a list. This option 
    is available for CVS. This, or a similar option, may or may not be available 
    for other repository types.</dd>
  <dt><b>Compare With &gt; Each Other</b></dt>
  <dd>compares two or three selected resources with each other</dd>
  <dt><b>Compare With &gt; Revision</b></dt>
  <dd>compares the selected resource with a version of the same resource that 
    was committed to the active branch. This requires you to choose a revision 
    of the resource from a list. This option is available for CVS. This, or a 
    similar option, may or may not be available for other repository types.</dd>
  <dt><b>Compare With &gt; Local History</b></dt>
  <dd>compares the selected resource to one that is in the local history, which 
    is maintained when you save changes. (<em>Tip:</em> to configure the size 
    and depth of your local history, look under <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; 
    General &gt; Workspace &gt; Local History</b>.)</dd>
</dl>

<p><em>Tip:</em> You can customize the behavior of the comparison editor by selecting 
  <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Compare/Patch</b> from the main 
  menu bar. You can select to &quot;lock scroll&quot; the pane contents, as well 
  as setting options for showing conflicts with other team members and changing 
  the default font.</p>
