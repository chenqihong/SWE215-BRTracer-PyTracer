<h1 class="Head">Finding out who to blame with the Annotate command</h1>
<p>Let's say you have found a bug on line 65 of a file and you don't understand 
  the code. Who do you ask, or blame, for the change? Well you could start by 
  looking at the resource history for the file, but that won't tell you who changed 
  that particular line. This is why the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Annotate</span> command is useful. You can pick any 
  ASCII file (see note on binary files) and get a listing of who changed what 
  line. </p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Annotation</span> action
is
available form the following places: History View, Repository Explorer,
Synchronize View, and the Resource and Packages View. When the annotate
is run you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Step through changes in the Annotate View and the text editor
will highlight the associated lines associated with the selected change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can select a line in the text file and the Annotate View
will
select the change that is associated with that line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The History View will show the history for the opened file and
highlight the revision of the currently selected change. This allow you
to quickly see the commit comment for a particular change. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Only works with text files</h2>
<p>The annotate command will only work with files that are marked as ASCII in 
  the CVS repository. Also, the command will open a text file to show the changes 
  even if the associated editor in the workbench is a non-text editor. For example, 
  if you run annotate on a plugin.xml file a simple text editor will be opened 
  instead of the full PDE editor.</p>
