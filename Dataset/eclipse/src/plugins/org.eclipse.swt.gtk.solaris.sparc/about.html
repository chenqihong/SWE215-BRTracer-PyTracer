<p>The &quot;GTK+ Binding&quot; is a binding to the GTK+ API.  The Content may include any or all of the following files:</p>

<p>The following files in the plug-in JAR shall be defined as the native code portion of the GTK+ Binding:</p>
<ul>
	<li>libswt-atk-gtk-xxxx.so (where &quot;xxxx&quot; is the version number)</li>
	<li>libswt-pi-gtk-xxxx.so (where &quot;xxxx&quot; is the version number)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following files in both the plug-in JAR and the src.zip shall be defined respectively as the bytecode and source code portions of the GTK+ Binding:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The contents of the directory org/eclipse/swt/internal/accessibility/gtk (but not including any sub-directories)</li>
	<li>The contents of the directory org/eclipse/swt/internal/cde (but not including any sub-directories)</li>

<p>The GTK+ Binding contains portions of GTK+ (&quot;Library&quot;).  GTK+ is made available by The Free Software Foundation.  Use of the Library is governed by the terms and
conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1 (&quot;LGPL&quot;).  Use of the GTK+ Binding on a standalone
basis, is also governed by the terms and conditions of the LGPL.  A copy of the LGPL is provided with the Content (<a href="about_files/lgpl-v21.txt" target="_blank">about_files/lgpl-v21.txt</a>) and is also available at

<p>In accordance with Section 6 of the LGPL, you may combine or link a "work that uses the Library" (e.g. the SWT) with the Library to produce a work
containing portions of the Library (e.g. the GTK+ Binding) and distribute that work under the terms of your choice (e.g. the EPL) provided you comply with all
other terms and conditions of Section 6 as well as other Sections of the LGPL.  Please note, if you modify the GTK+ Binding such modifications shall be
governed by the terms and conditions of the LGPL.  Also note, the terms of the EPL permit you to modify the combined work and the source code of the combined
work is provided for debugging purposes so there is no need to reverse engineer the combined work.</p>
