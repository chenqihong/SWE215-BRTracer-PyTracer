Provides support for performing various install/update operations from the command line.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package contains interfaces for performing update/install operations 
without using the Update Manager user interface. In general, it is best to use these
classes for command line invocation, but it is possible to also use them programmatically.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This package is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to
change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback
from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
(repeatedly) as the API evolves.
