<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package contains interfaces and helper classes for creating and executing search operations. 

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This package is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to
change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback
from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
(repeatedly) as the API evolves.
