/**
 * A Subscriber provides synchronization between local resources and a
 * remote location that is used to share those resources.
 * <p>
 * When queried for the <code>SyncInfo</code> corresponding to a local resource using 
 * <code>getSyncInfo(IResource)</code>, the subscriber should not contact the server. 
 * Server round trips should only occur within the <code>refresh<code>
 * method of the subscriber. Consequently,
 * the implementation of a subscriber must cache enough state information for a remote resource to calculate the 
 * synchronization state without contacting the server.  During a refresh, the latest remote resource state 
 * information should be fetched and cached. For
 * a subscriber that supports three-way compare, the refresh should also fetch the latest base state unless this is
 * available by some other means (e.g. for some repository tools, the base state is persisted on disk with the
 * local resources).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After a refresh, the subscriber must notify any listeners of local resources whose corresponding remote resource 
 * or base resource changed. The subscriber does not need to notify listeners when the state changes due to a local
 * modification since local changes are available through the <code>IResource</code> delta mechanism. However, 
 * the subscriber must
 * cache enough information (e.g. the local timestamp of when the file was in-sync with its corresponding remote 
 * resource)
 * to determine if the file represents an outgoing change so that <code>SyncInfo</code> obtained
 * after a delta will indicate that the file has an outgoing change. The subscriber must also notify listeners 
 * when roots and added 
 * or removed. For example, a subscriber for a repository provider would fire a root added event when a project 
 * was shared
 * with a repository. No event is required when a root is deleted as this is available through the 
 * <code>IResource</code> delta mechanism. It is up to clients to re-query the subscriber
 * when the state of a resource changes locally by listening to IResource deltas.
 * </p><p>
 * The remote and base states can also include the state for resources that do not exist locally (i.e outgoing deletions 
 * or incoming additions). When queried for the members of a local resource, the subscriber should include any children
 * for which a remote exists even if the local does not.
 * </p>
