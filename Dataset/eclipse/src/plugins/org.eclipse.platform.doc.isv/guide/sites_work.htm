<H2>How sites work</H2>
<p>The following example shows the internal structure of a Site. Sites procure 
  some context from their owner as well as expose a set of adapters. The site 
  combines the context from its parent with the default dependencies from the 
  <span style="font-style: italic;">org.eclipse.core.components.types </span>extension 
  point to compute the dependencies for its part. If it needs to create any dependencies 
  from a factory, it remembers those objects so that it can send them lifecycle 
  notifications later. <br>
  <br>
  The adapters that a site returns to its owner are created in a similar manner. 
  If the part implements an adapter, the site returns it directly. Otherwise, 
  it looks for a default adapter from the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">org.eclipse.core.components.types </span>extension 
  point. <br>
  <br>
  To avoid any confusion, this should be said explicitly: the adapters that a 
  site returns to its owner are not the same as the adapters it returns to an 
  old-style part. The adapters that an old-style part gets from its site are dependencies, 
  whereas the adapters that a site returns to its parent are adapters for the 
  part itself.<br>
