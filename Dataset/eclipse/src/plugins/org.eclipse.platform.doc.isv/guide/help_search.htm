Information Search</h1>





<p>Since Eclipse 3.1, search in the workbench has been partitioned into two 
major categories: development artifact search and information search. The former 
is handled by the search dialog opened from the Search menu. The later is 
available from Help&gt;Search menu item which opens the new Help view into the 
Search page.</p>
<p>The new information search facility uses multiple search engines run in 
parallel using the same search expression. Eclipse provides a number of 
preconfigured search engines. New engines can be added programmatically or by 
the user. All the results are collated in the Search page directly.</p>
