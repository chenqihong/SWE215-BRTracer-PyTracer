<h3>Primary feature</h3>
<p>In Eclipse 2.1, the notion of a <b>primary feature</b> was used to customize
  the product-branding aspects of a product. This mechanism is still supported
  in Eclipse 3.0,
but is effectively deprecated.  Newly developed products should use the <a href="product_def_extpt.htm">products
extension point</a>
to define a product.
</p>
<p>The remainder of this discussion describes the legacy product definition using
  primary features.</p>
<p>When the Eclipse platform is started, exactly one feature can control
  the overall &quot;personality&quot; or &quot;branding&quot; of the platform,
  including the splash screen, window images, about box, welcome page, and other
  customizable aspects of the platform.&nbsp; This feature is called the product's <b>primary feature</b>.</p>
<p>Let's look again at the description of the platform feature from Eclipse 2.1:</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;feature
      id="org.eclipse.platform"
      label="%featureName"
      version="2.1.0"
      provider-name="%providerName"
      plugin=""
      image="eclipse_update_120.jpg"
      <b>primary="true"</b>
      application="org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench"&gt;
      ...</pre>
<p>The platform feature has been designated as a primary feature. Although it's
possible to designate many features as primary features in their <b>feature.xml</b> 
files, only one primary feature gets control when the platform is launched. This
is controlled by setting the <b>eclipse.product</b> property in the  product's <b>config.ini </b>file
underneath
the <b>eclipse/configuration</b>
directory.&nbsp; If there are multiple eligible primary features, the <b>-product </b>command
line option for <b>eclipse.exe</b> overrides the choice made in <b>config.ini</b>.</p>
