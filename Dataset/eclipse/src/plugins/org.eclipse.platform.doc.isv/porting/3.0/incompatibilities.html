<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 2.1 and 3.0</h1>

<p> Eclipse changed in
incompatible ways between 2.1 and 3.0 in ways that affect plug-ins. The
following entries describe the areas that changed and provide instructions for
  migrating
2.1 plug-ins to 3.0. Note that you only need to look here if you are experiencing
  problems running your 2.1 plug-in on 3.0.</p>

<h2><a name="Plug-in manifest version"></a>1. Plug-in manifest version</h2>
<p>The header of the manifest files for plug-ins (and plug-in fragments) has
changed to include a new line which identifies the appropriate plug-in manifest
version. Prior to 3.0, plug-ins did not carry one of these &lt;?eclipse ...?&gt;
lines; after 3.0, they must always have one. This change is to allow the Eclipse
runtime to reliably recognize pre-3.0 plug-ins that have not been ported to 3.0,
so that it can automatically provide greater binary compatibility for such
plug-ins. This is the general form of the plugin.xml file (fragment.xml is
similar):</p>
<p><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>
<u>&lt;?eclipse version=&quot;3.0&quot;?&gt;<br>
</u>&lt;plugin ...&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
&lt;/plugin&gt;</code></p>
<p>Plug-in manifests created by PDE 3.0 automatically have this form. <strong>It
    is strongly recommended that you use the PDE plug-in migration tool.</strong> It
    automatically inserts the indicated line into the
  manifest
  of 2.1 plug-ins and plug-in
fragments and addresses many of the other changes described here.</p>
<p>If you do add this directive to a plugin.xml (manually or using PDE), the
file must also be updated to explicitly list the plug-ins on which it depends.
For example, prior to Eclipse 3.0 dependencies on org.eclipse.core.runtime and
org.eclipse.core.boot were implicit. With 3.0, org.eclipse.core.boot is no
longer needed and developers must choose org.eclipse.core.runtime or
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility (or neither) as appropriate.</p>
<p>Note: This is one of the incompatibilities that does <b>not</b> impact how
2.1 binary plug-ins are run by Eclipse 3.0.</p>
<h2><a name="Restructuring of Platform UI plug-ins"></a>2. Restructuring of Platform UI plug-ins</h2>
<p>The org.eclipse.ui plug-in, which used to be the main Platform UI plug-in,
now provides just the API and extension points for the generic (i.e.,
non-IDE-specific) workbench. Optional and IDE-specific API and extension points
have moved to other plug-ins.</p>
<p>The impact of this change is two-fold: (1) the moved org.eclipse.ui extension
points have new extension point ids; and (2) the list of required plug-ins has
changed.</p>
<p>The org.eclipse.ui extension points in the following table have moved to
different plug-ins, causing their extension point ids to change. If an existing
plug-in contributes an extension to the moved extension points, then the
reference in the &quot;point&quot; attribute of the &lt;extension&gt; element in
the plug-in manifest file must be changed to refer to the corresponding new ones
extension point id. The PDE plug-in migration tool makes these fix-ups.</p>
<p>Note: This is one of the incompatibilities that does <b>not</b> impact how
2.1 binary plug-ins are run by Eclipse 3.0. The Eclipse 3.0 runtime automatically detects pre-3.0 plug-ins (by the
absence of the aforementioned &lt;?eclipse version=&quot;3.0&quot;?&gt; line in the plug-in manifest)
and automatically compensates for these extension point and plug-in dependency
changes.</p>

</table>
<p>The following table lists the API packages formerly provided by the
org.eclipse.ui plug-in that have been moved to different plug-ins. (The names of
the API packages, classes, fields, and methods did not change.) In some cases,
the API packages are now split across more than one plug-in. Since the API
classes visible to any given plug-in are determined by that plug-in's list of
required plug-ins, these changes may require adjusting
&quot;&lt;requires&gt;&quot; elements in an existing plug-in's manifest to
regain access to API class.</p>
<p>This change only affects plug-ins that depend on the org.eclipse.ui plug-in
(that is, includes &lt;import plugin=&quot;org.eclipse.ui&quot;/&gt; in the
&lt;requires&gt; section of the plug-in manifest); all other plug-ins are
unaffected. If it is affected, you <i>may</i> need to change the &lt;import&gt;
element, or add additional &lt;import&gt; elements, so that all the API classes
your plug-in needs are in scope. We strongly recommend that plug-ins only state
dependencies on the plug-ins that they actually use. Including unnecessary
dependencies reduces runtime performance because the Java class loader must
search for classes in all dependents. (The PDE plug-in migration tool will fix
up the dependencies, and help to determine a minimal set.)</p>

<h2><a name="Restructuring of Platform Core Runtime plug-ins"></a>3. Restructuring of Platform Core Runtime plug-ins</h2>
<p>The Eclipse 3.0 Platform Runtime is based on OSGi, necessitating changes to
the structure of the two Platform Runtime plug-ins, org.eclipse.core.runtime and
org.eclipse.core.boot.</p>
<p>A new org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in provides an
implementation bridge between the old and new APIs, and is the new home for many
of the obsolete APIs formerly found in org.eclipse.core.runtime and
org.eclipse.core.boot. Platform Runtime extension points are unaffected by the
restructuring.</p>
<p>When migrating the existing plug-in to 3.0, the plug-in's
manifest needs to be updated to reflect the new structure of the Eclipse
Platform Runtime plug-ins. The PDE plug-in manifest migration tool will add a
dependency to org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility if required.</p>
<p>Note also that if you mark you plug-in as 3.0 (using &lt;?eclipse version=&quot;3.0&quot;?&gt;)
and your plug-in defines a Plugin class, you must either explicitly &lt;import
plugin=&quot;org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility&quot;/&gt; in the plug-in
manifest or ensure that the Plugin class defines the default constructor.</p>
<p>Note: This is one of the incompatibilities that does <b>not</b> impact how
2.1 binary plug-ins are run by Eclipse 3.0. The Eclipse 3.0 runtime automatically detects pre-3.0 plug-ins
(by the
absence of the &lt;?eclipse version=&quot;3.0&quot;?&gt; line in the plug-in manifest)
and automatically compensates for these changes to the Platform Runtime.</p>
<h2><a name="Removal of Xerces plug-in"></a>4. Removal of Xerces plug-in</h2>
<p>The org.eclipse.xerces plug-in is no longer necessary and has been deleted.
XML parsing
support is built in to J2SE 1.4, and the presence of the Xerces plug-in creates class loader conflicts. The
javax.xml.parsers, org.w3c.dom.*, and org.xml.sax.*
API packages formerly provided by the org.eclipse.xerces plug-in are now
available from the J2SE libraries.</p>
<p>If your plug-in requires the org.eclipse.xerces plug-in, you must change your plug-in
manifest to remove this stated dependency. Once that is done, the plug-in's code
should compile and run without further change.</p>
<p>A 2.1 binary plug-ins with a stated dependency on the org.eclipse.xerces
plug-in will be missing a prerequisite when run in a standard Eclipse 3.0
configuration. The plug-in will not be activated as a consequence.</p>
<h2><a name="Eclipse 3.0 is more concurrent"></a>5. Eclipse 3.0 is more concurrent</h2>
<p>Prior to Eclipse 3.0, Eclipse operated mostly in a single thread. Most API
methods and extension points operated either in the UI thread, or in a thread
spawned from a progress dialog that blocked the UI thread. Most plug-in writers
did not have to worry much about thread safety, apart from ensuring that all UI
activity occurred in the UI thread. In Eclipse 3.0, there is generally much more
concurrency. Many operations now occur in a background thread, where they may
run concurrently with other threads, including the UI thread. All plug-ins whose
code runs in a background thread must now be aware of the thread safety of their
code.</p>
<p>In addition to plug-ins that are explicitly running operations in the
background using the <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs</code> API, there are
several platform API facilities and extension points that make use of background
threads. Plug-ins that hook into these facilities need to ensure that their code
is thread safe. The following table summarizes the API and extension points that
run some or all of their code in a background thread in Eclipse 3.0:</p>

</table>
<p>There are various strategies available for making code thread safe. A naive
solution is to ensure all work occurs in the UI thread, thus ensuring serialized
execution. This is a common approach for UI plug-ins that are not doing
CPU-intensive processing. When doing this, be aware of the deadlock risk
inherent in <code>Display.syncExec</code>. <code>Display.asyncExec</code> is generally
safer as it does not introduce deadlock risk, at the expense of losing precise
control over when the code is executed.</p>
<p>Other techniques for making thread safe code include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wrapping unsafe code in semaphores or Java monitors. The new concurrency
    infrastructure includes one such semaphore object: <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs.ILock</code>.
    The advantage of <code>ILock</code> over generic locks is that they transfer
    automatically to the UI thread when doing a <code>syncExec</code>, and there is
    deadlock detection support built into their implementation that logs and
    then resolves deadlocks.</li>
  <li>Message queues. Code can be serialized by forwarding all processing to a
    message queue that is processed serially in a single thread. One such
    example is the SWT deferred event queue (<code>Display.asyncExec</code>), which
    is processed entirely in the UI thread.</li>
  <li>Immutable objects. Make data structures immutable, and make new copies on
    modification. This is the approach used to make data structures such as <code>java.lang.String</code>
    and <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPath</code> thread safe. The advantage of
    immutable objects is extremely fast read access, at the cost of extra work
    on modification.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Opening editors on IFiles"></a>6. Opening editors on IFiles</h2>
<p>The following methods were deleted from the org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchPage interface.
IWorkbenchPage is declared in the generic workbench, but the methods are inherently
resource-specific.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>public IEditorPart openEditor(IFile input)</li>
      <li>public IEditorPart openEditor(IFile input, String editorID)</li>
      <li>public IEditorPart openEditor(IFile input, String editorID, boolean
        activate)</li>
      <li>public IEditorPart openEditor(IMarker marker)</li>
      <li>public IEditorPart openEditor(IMarker marker, boolean activate)</li>
      <li>public void openSystemEditor(IFile input)</li>
    </ul>
<p>Clients of these IWorkbenchPage.openEditor methods should instead call the
corresponding public static
    methods declared in the class org.eclipse.ui.ide.IDE (in the org.eclipse.ui.ide plug-in).</p>
<p>Clients of these IWorkbenchPage.openSystemEditor(IFile) method should convert the IFile to an
    IEditorInput using new FileEditorInput(IFile) and then call the
    openEditor(IEditorInput,String) method. In other words, rewrite
page.openSystemEditor(file) as page.openEditor(new FileEditorInput(file),
IEditorRegistry.SYSTEM_EXTERNAL_EDITOR_ID). Note: clients using editor id
        IEditorRegistry.SYSTEM_EXTERNAL_EDITOR_ID must pass an editor input
        which implements org.eclipse.ui.IPathEditorInput (which FileEditorInput
        does).</p>
Note: This is one of the incompatibilities that does <b>not</b> impact how
2.1 binary plug-ins are run by Eclipse 3.0. Eclipse 3.0 includes a binary runtime compatibility mechanism that
    ensures existing 2.1 plug-in binaries using any of the deleted openEditor
    and openSystemEditor methods continue to work as in 2.1 in spite of this API change.
(The deleted methods are effectively &quot;added back&quot; by
    the org.eclipse.ui.workbench.compatibility fragment.)
<h2><a name="Editor goto marker"></a>7. Editor goto marker</h2>
<p>The following method was deleted from the org.eclipse.ui.IEditorPart
interface. IEditorPart is declared in the generic workbench, but the method is inherently
resource-specific.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>public void gotoMarker(IMarker marker)</li>
    </ul>
The corresponding methods were also deleted from the classes in the
org.eclipse.ui.part package that implement IEditorPart, namely EditorPart,
MultiEditor, MultiPageEditorPart, and MultiPageEditor.&nbsp;
<p>Clients that call this method should instead test if the editor part
implements or adapts to org.eclipse.ui.ide.IGotoMarker (in the org.eclipse.ui.ide
plug-in) and if so, call gotoMarker(IMarker). The IDE class has a convenience
method for doing so: IDE.gotoMarker(editor, marker);</p>
Clients that implement an editor that can position itself based on IMarker
information should implement or adapt to org.eclipse.ui.ide.IGotoMarker.
<p>Since IGotoMarker's only method is gotoMarker(IMarker) and has the same
signature and specification as the old IEditorPart.gotoMarker(IMarker), existing
editor implementations can adapt to this change simply by including IGotoMarker
in the implements clause of the class definition.</p>
<p>A 2.1 binary plug-ins with code that calls this method will get an class
linking error exception when run in a standard Eclipse 3.0
configuration.</p>
<h2><a name="Editor launcher"></a>8. Editor launcher</h2>
<p>The editor launcher interface org.eclipse.ui.IEditorLauncher is implemented by plug-ins that contribute
    external editors. The following method was removed from this interface. IEditorLauncher
is declared in the generic workbench, but the method is inherently
resource-specific.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>public void open(IFile file)</li>
    </ul>
<p>It was replaced by</p>
    <ul>
      <li>public void open(IPath file)</li>
    </ul>
Clients that call IEditorLauncher.open(file) should instead call
IEditorLauncher.open(file.getLocation()). Clients that implement this interface should
replace (or augment) their implementation
    of open(IFile) by one for open(IPath).
<p>A 2.1 binary plug-ins with code that calls this method will get an class
linking error exception when run in a standard Eclipse 3.0
configuration.</p>
<h2><a name="Editor registry"></a>9. Editor registry</h2>
<p>The following methods were removed from the org.eclipse.ui.IEditorRegistry interface.
IEditorRegistry is declared in the generic workbench, but the methods are inherently
resource-specific.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>public IEditorDescriptor getDefaultEditor(IFile file)</li>
      <li>public void setDefaultEditor(IFile file, String editorId)</li>
      <li>public IEditorDescriptor[] getEditors(IFile file)</li>
      <li>public ImageDescriptor getImageDescriptor(IFile file)</li>
    </ul>
Clients that call getEditors(file) or getImageDescriptor(file) should call the
    &quot;String&quot; equivalent methods:
<ul>
      <li>Rewrite registry.getEditors(file) to be
        registry.getEditors(file.getName())</li>
      <li>Rewrite registry.getImageDescriptor(file) to be registry.getImageDescriptor(file.getName())</li>
</ul>
Clients that call setDefaultEditor(IFile file, String editorId) and
    getDefaultEditor(IFile file) should should instead call the corresponding public static
    methods declared in the class org.eclipse.ui.ide.IDE (in the org.eclipse.ui.ide
plug-in):
    <ul>
      <li>Rewrite registry.getDefaultEditor(file) to be
        IDE.getDefaultEditor(file)</li>
      <li>Rewrite registry.setDefaultEditor(file, id) to be IDE.setDefaultEditor(file,
        id)</li>
    </ul>
Also, the API contract for the method IEditorRegistrygetDefaultEditor() was
changed. This method, which is also now deprecated, and will
        always return the System External Editor editor descriptor. This change impacts clients that assumed the default editor returned
        would be a text editor.
<p>There are new constants that represent the system external editor and system
    in-place editor identifiers (SYSTEM_EXTERNAL_EDITOR_ID and
    SYSTEM_INPLACE_EDITOR_ID). These two editors require an editor input that
    implements or adapts to org.eclipse.ui.IPathEditorInput. Note that the in-place
    editor descriptor will not exist in Eclipse configurations that do not support in-place
    editing.</p>
<h2><a name="Workbench marker help registry"></a>10. Workbench marker help
registry</h2>
<p>The following method was deleted from the org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbench interface.
IWorkbench is declared in the generic workbench, but the method is inherently
resource-specific.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>public IMarkerHelpRegistry getMarkerHelpRegistry()</li>
    </ul>
Clients of IWorkbench.getMarkerHelpRegistry() should instead call the public static
    method org.eclipse.ui.ide.IDE.getMarkerHelpRegistry() (in the org.eclipse.ui.ide plug-in).
<p>A 2.1 binary plug-ins with code that calls this method will get an exception when run in a standard Eclipse 3.0
configuration.</p>
<h2><a name="Text editor document providers"></a>11. Text editor document providers</h2>
<p>In order to make org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.AbstractTextEditor independent of
IFile, org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.AbstractDocumentProvider introduces the concept
    of a document provider operation (DocumentProviderOperation) and a document
    provider operation runner (IRunnableContext). When requested to perform
    reset, save, or synchronize, AbstractDocumentProvider creates document
    provider operations and uses the operation runner to execute them. The
    runnable context can be provided by subclasses via the getOperationRunner
    method. Here is a summary of the changes that clients must adapt to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added protected abstract IRunnableContext getOperationRunner();
    non-abstract subclasses must implement this method in order to provide their
    own operation runner.</li>
  <li>The method resetDocument has been changed to final in order to allow the
    document provider to wrap the function with a document provider operation.
    The document provider operation calls the newly introduced doResetDocument
    method. AbstractDocumentProvider.doResetDocument contains the code that
    originally resided inside AbstractDocumentProvider.resetDocument. Subclasses
    must change their implementation of resetDocument to doResetDocument and any
    contained call of super.resetDocument to super.doResetDocument.</li>
  <li>The method saveDocument has been changed to final in order to allow the
    document provider to wrap the function with a document provider operation.
    The document provider operation calls the newly introduced doSaveDocument
    method. AbstractDocumentProvider.doSaveDocument contains the code that
    originally resided inside AbstractDocumentProvider.saveDocument. Subclasses
    must change their implementation of saveDocument to doSaveDocument and any
    contained call of super.saveDocument to super.doSaveDocument.</li>
  <li>The method synchronize has been changed to final in order to allow the
    document provider to wrap the function with a document provider operation.
    The document provider operation calls the newly introduced doSynchronize
    method. AbstractDocumentProvider.doSynchronize contains the code that
    originally resided inside AbstractDocumentProvider.synchronize. Subclasses
    must change their implementation of synchronize to doSynchronize and any
    contained call of super.synchronized to super.doSynchronize.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AbstractDocumentProvider subclass org.eclipse.ui.editors.text.StorageDocumentProvider
implements the getOperationRunner method to always returns null. This means that
subclasses of StorageDocumentProvider should
    not be affected by this change.</p>
<p>The StorageDocumentProvider subclass org.eclipse.ui.editors.text.FileDocumentProvider
implements the getOperationRunner method that returns an IRunnableContext for executing the given DocumentProviderOperations
    inside a WorkspaceModifyOperation. Other changes to FileDocumentProvider
are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>resetDocument(Object) has been replaced by
    doResetDocument(Object,IProgressMonitor).</li>
  <li> synchronize(Object) has been replaced by
    doSynchronize(Object,IProgressMonitor).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Text editors"></a>12. Text editors</h2>
<p>Changes to org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.AbstractTextEditor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The method IEditorPart.gotoMarker(IMarker marker) was removed from the
    IEditorPart interface because it was resource-specific. The default
    implementation provided by AbstractTextEditor has been removed from
    AbstractTextEditor and has been moved to AbstractDecoratedTextEditor. Direct
    subclasses of AbstractTextEditor or StatusTextEditor that want to provide
    that functionality should follow the migration instructions for
    IEditorPart [ref Editor goto marker].</li>
  <li>AbstractTextEditor no longer differentiates between implicit and
    explicit document providers as the concrete implementation was resource
    specific. This functionality has been moved to AbstractDecoratedTextEditor. Direct
    subclasses of AbstractTextEditor or StatusTextEditor must perform the
    following steps:
    <ul>
      <li>Override getDocumentProvider.</li>
      <li>Override the newly introduced hook method for disposing the document
        provider (disposeDocumentProvider)</li>
      <li>Override the newly introduced hook method
        setDocumentProvider(IEditorInput) that is called while updating the
        document provider for the new editor input. I.e., that is the method in
        which you can configure the appropriate implicit document provider for
        the given editor input.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All internal occurrences of WorkspaceModifyOperation have been removed. The
    editor now calls the document provider methods directly (see described
    changes for document providers);
    <ul>
      <li>Removed createSaveOperation, changed performSaveOperation to
        performSave. Subclasses of AbstractTextEditor overriding
        createSaveOperation or performSaveOperation must now override
        performSave.</li>
      <li>Removed createdRevertOperation, changed peformRevertOperation to
        performRevert. Sunclasses overriding createRevertOperation or
        performRevertOperation must now override performRevert.</li>
      <li>The implementation of the method handleEditorInputChanged has been
        changed to not use WorkbenchModifyingOperation. Subclasses overriding
        handleEditorInputChange must adapt accordingly. Please use the changes
        applied to AbstractTextEditor.handleEditorInputChange as the blueprint.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>AbstractTextEditor.createActions no longer registers any actions under
    ITextEditorActionConstants.ADD_TASK and ITextEditorActionConstant.BOOKMARK
    as those actions are IDE-specific. The registration of these actions has
    been moved to AbstractDecoratedTextEditor. Direct subclasses of AbstractTextEditor or
    StatusTextEditor should override the createActions method and add the
    following lines (accordingly adapted to their circumstances):</li>
  <li>
    <pre> ResourceAction action= new AddMarkerAction(TextEditorMessages.getResourceBundle(), &quot;Editor.AddBookmark.&quot;, this, IMarker.BOOKMARK, true); //$NON-NLS-1$
  action.setHelpContextId(ITextEditorHelpContextIds.BOOKMARK_ACTION);
  action.setActionDefinitionId(ITextEditorActionDefinitionIds.ADD_BOOKMARK);
  setAction(IDEActionFactory.BOOKMARK.getId(), action);     </pre>
    <pre>  action= new AddTaskAction(TextEditorMessages.getResourceBundle(), &quot;Editor.AddTask.&quot;, this); //$NON-NLS-1$
  action.setHelpContextId(ITextEditorHelpContextIds.ADD_TASK_ACTION);
  action.setActionDefinitionId(ITextEditorActionDefinitionIds.ADD_TASK);
  setAction(IDEActionFactory.ADD_TASK.getId(), action);</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The AbstractTextEditor subclass org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.StatusTextEditor provides the predicate method isErrorStatus(IStatus).
    Subclasses may override in order to decide whether a given status must
    considered an error or not.</p>
<p>Changes to org.eclipse.ui.editors.text.AbstractDecoratedTextEditor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The IEditorPart method gotoMarker(IMarker marker) has been deprecated to
    allow a future change of its visibility. Clients of this method must follow
    the migration instructions in the deprecation message.</li>
  <li>AbstractDecoratedTextEditor returns an adapter for IGotoMarker.</li>
  <li>AbstractDecoratedTextEditor implements the concept of implicit/explicit document
    providers previously provided by AbstractTextEditor, as discussed above.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Headless annotation support"></a>13. Headless annotation support</h2>
<p>As part of the introduction of headless annotation support, the following changes to Annotation were made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removed static Annotation.drawImage methods, use org.eclipse.jface.text.source.ImageUtilities instead.</li>
  <li>Removed setLayer, getLayer, and paint methods from Annotation, annotations which want to draw
      themselves should implement IAnnotationPresentation.</li>
  <li>MarkerAnnotation now directly implements the methods removed from Annotation (setLayer, getLayer, paint).</li>
  <li>The following classes have been moved from the plug-in org.eclipse.jface.text to the plug-in 
      org.eclipse.text, the package names remain the same and org.eclipse.jface.text rexports the classes from org.eclipse.jface.text,
      such that this change is transparent to clients:</li>
</ul>
<pre>        org.eclipse.jface.text.source.Annotation 
        org.eclipse.jface.text.source.AnnotationModel 
        org.eclipse.jface.text.source.AnnotationModelEvent 
        org.eclipse.jface.text.source.IAnnotationModel 
        org.eclipse.jface.text.source.IAnnotationModelListener 
        org.eclipse.jface.text.source.IAnnotationModelListenerExtension</pre>
<h2> <a name="Console view"></a>14. Console view</h2>
<p>Eclipse 3.0 has new generic console support. The generic console is available via the Window
&gt; Show View &gt; Basic &gt; Console,
and is used by the Eclipse debug and Ant integration.</p>
<p>The view id for the console has changed from org.eclipse.debug.ui.ConsoleView
to org.eclipse.ui.console.ConsoleView. 2.1 plug-ins that programmatically open
the console will be unsuccessful because that the old view no longer exists.</p>
<h2><a name="Java breakpoint listeners"></a>15. Java breakpoint listeners</h2>
<p>In 3.0, the return types for the methods org.eclipse.jdt.debug.core.IJavaBreakpointListener.breakpointHit(IJavaBreakpoint, IJavaThread) and
installingBreakpoing(IJavaTarget, IJavaBreakpoint, IJavaType) changed from
boolean to int to allow listeners to vote &quot;don't care&quot;. In releases
prior to 3.0, listeners could only vote &quot;suspend&quot; or &quot;don't
suspend&quot; when a breakpoint was hit, and &quot;install&quot; or &quot;don't
install&quot; when a breakpoint was about to be installed. In 3.0, listeners can
also vote &quot;don't care&quot; for either of these notifications. This allows
clients to only make a decisive vote in situations that they care about. For
&quot;breakpoint hit&quot; notifications, the breakpoint will suspend if any
listeners vote &quot;suspend&quot;, or all listeners vote &quot;don't
care&quot;; and it will not suspend if at least one listener votes &quot;don't
suspend&quot; and no listeners vote &quot;suspend&quot;. Similarly, for
&quot;breakpoint installing&quot; notifications, the breakpoint will be
installed if any listeners vote to install, or all listeners vote &quot;don't
care&quot;; and it will not be installed if at least one listener votes
&quot;don't install&quot; and no listeners vote &quot;install&quot;. In general,
implementors should return DONT_CARE unless they have a strong opinion one way
or the other. It is important to keep in mind, for example, that voting
&quot;suspend&quot; will override any other listener's vote of &quot;don't
suspend&quot;.</p>
<p>The IJavaBreakpointListener interface is implemented by clients that create
or react to breakpoints in Java code. There are likely few clients beyond JDT
itself, save the one that reported the problem (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37760">bug
37760</a>) that this change remedies. This is a breaking change for existing
code that implements the IJavaBreakpointListener interface. This code needs to
be modified to return an appropriate int value before it will compile or run in
3.0.</p>
<h2><a name="Clipboard access in UI thread"></a>16. Clipboard access in UI thread</h2>
<p>Prior to 3.0, the methods on the SWT class org.eclipse.swt.dnd.Clipboard were tacitly permitted
to run in threads other than the UI thread. This oversight resulted in failures
on GTK where the operating system requires that all clipboard interactions be
performed in the UI thread. The oversight was not revealed earlier because many
applications are single-threaded and receive most of their testing on Windows.
In order for the Clipboard API to be sustainable and cross-platform, in 3.0 the
specification and implementation of all Clipboard API methods have been changed
to throw an SWT Exception (ERROR_THREAD_INVALID_ACCESS) if invoked from a non-UI
thread. Clipboard services are commonly provided automatically by Eclipse
components such as the text editor, which insulate many clients from this
breaking change. Existing code that does make direct use of Clipboard should
ensure that the API methods are called on the correct thread, using
Display.asyncExec or syncExec when appropriate to shift accesses into the UI thread.</p>
<h2><a name="Key down events"></a>17. Key down events</h2>
<p>In 3.0, SWT reports key down events before the work is done in the OS. This
is much earlier than it was prior to 3.0. This change was made to support key
bindings in Eclipse which necessitates intercepting key events before any widget
has a chance to process the character. Consequences of this change are visible
to code that handles low-level org.eclipse.swt.SWT.KeyDown events directly. For example, it
means that when a listener on a Text widget receives a key down event, the
widget's content (getText()) will not yet include the key just typed (it would
have prior to 3.0). The recommended way to get the full text from the widget
including the current key is to handle the higher-level SWT.Modify or SWT.Verify
events rather than the low-level SWT.KeyDown event; code that already does it this way
is unaffected by this change.</p>
<h2><a name="Tab traversal of custom controls"></a>18. Tab traversal of custom controls</h2>
<p>Prior to 3.0, when the focus was in the SWT class org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Canvas or one of its subclasses
(including custom widgets), typing Ctrl+Tab, Shift+Tab, Ctrl+PgUp, or Ctrl+PgDn
would automatically trigger traversal to the next/previous widget without
reporting a key event. This behavior was unspecified, and runs counter to the
rule that Canvases see every key typed in them. The proper way to handle
traversal is by registering a traverse listener. In order to properly support
Eclipse key bindings in 3.0, the default behavior was changed so that Canvas now
sees Ctrl+Tab, Shift+Tab, Ctrl+PgUp, and Ctrl+PgDn key events instead of
traversing. If you use a raw Canvas or define a subclass of Canvas, ensure that
that you register a traverse listener.</p>
<h2><a name="Selection event order in SWT table and tree widgets"></a>19. Selection event order in SWT table and tree widgets</h2>
<p>Mouse selections of items in the SWT classes org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Table and Tree generate the event
sequence MouseDown-Selection-MouseUp uniformly in all operating environments.
Similarly, keyboard selections generate the event sequence
KeyDown-Selection-KeyUp uniformly in all operating environments. Prior to 3.0,
the event order was not uniform, with Motif and Photon at variance with the rest
by always reporting the Selection event first; i.e., Selection-MouseDown-MouseUp
or Selection-KeyDown-KeyUp. For 3.0, the event order on Motif and Photon has
been changed to match the others. Existing code that was functioning correctly
on {Windows, GTK} and on {Motif, Photon} is unlikely to be affected. But it is
wise to check your code to ensure that it does not rely on an invalid event
order.</p>
<h2><a name="New severity level in status objects"></a>20. New severity level in status objects</h2>
<p><code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.IStatus</code> has a new severity constant, <code>IStatus.CANCEL</code>,
that can be used to indicate cancelation. Callers of <code>IStatus.getSeverity()</code>
that rely on the set of possible severities being limited to <code>IStatus.OK</code>,
<code>INFO</code>, <code>WARNING</code>, and <code>ERROR</code> are affected by this addition. Callers of
<code>getSeverity</code> should update 
their code to include the new severity.</p>
<h2><a name="Build-related resource change notifications"></a>21. Build-related resource change notifications</h2>
<p>In Eclipse 3.0, workspace auto-builds now occur in a background thread. This
required an API contract change to <code>org.eclipse.core.resources.IResourceChangeEvent</code>. The contract
of <code>IResourceChangeEvent</code> previously guaranteed the following ordering of
events for all workspace changes:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>PRE_DELETE</code> or <code>PRE_CLOSE</code> event notification if applicable</li>
  <li>Perform the operation</li>
  <li><code>PRE_AUTO_BUILD</code> event notification</li>
  <li>If auto-build is on, perform incremental workspace build</li>
  <li><code>POST_AUTO_BUILD</code> event notification</li>
  <li><code>POST_CHANGE</code> event notification</li>
</ol>
<p>With auto-build now running in the background, there is no longer any
guarantee about the temporal relationship between the <code>AUTO_BUILD</code> events
and the <code>POST_CHANGE</code> event. In Eclipse 3.0, steps 3-5 in the above
structure are removed from the operation. The resulting picture looks like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>PRE_DELETE</code> or <code>PRE_CLOSE</code> event notification if applicable</li>
  <li>Perform the operation</li>
  <li><code>POST_CHANGE</code> event notification</li>
</ol>
<p>Periodically, the platform will perform a background workspace build
operation. Note that this happens regardless of the whether auto-build is on or
off. The exact timing of when this build occurs will not be specified. The
structure of the build operation will look like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>PRE_BUILD</code> event notification (<code>PRE_BUILD</code> is the
    new name for <code>PRE_AUTO_BUILD)</code></li>
  <li>If auto-build is on, perform incremental workspace build</li>
  <li><code>POST_BUILD</code> event notification (<code>POST_BUILD</code> is the
    new name for <code>POST_AUTO_BUILD)</code></li>
  <li><code>POST_CHANGE</code> event notification</li>
</ol>
<p>The reference point for the deltas received by auto-build listeners will be
different from post-change listeners. Build listeners will receive notification
of all changes since the end of the last build operation. Post-change listeners
will receive a delta describing all changes since the last post-change
notification. This new structure retains three characteristics of resource
change listeners that have been true since Eclipse 1.0:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>POST_CHANGE</code> listeners receive notification of absolutely all
    resource changes that occur during the time they are registered. This
    includes changes made by builders, and changes made by other listeners.</li>
  <li><code>PRE_AUTO_BUILD</code> listeners receive notification of all resource
    changes <b>except</b> changes made by builders and resource change
    listeners.</li>
  <li><code>POST_AUTO_BUILD</code> listeners receive notification of all resource
    changes <b>except</b> changes made by other <code>POST_AUTO_BUILD</code>
    listeners.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some important differences with this approach. Prior to
Eclipse 3.0, auto-build listeners were always called before <code>POST_CHANGE</code>
listeners. For this reason, the delta received by auto-build listeners was
always a subset of the delta received by the <code>POST_CHANGE</code> listeners.
This relationship is now essentially reversed. Auto-build listeners will receive
a delta that is a super-set of all deltas supplied to <code>POST_CHANGE</code>
listeners since the end of the last background build. As before, auto-build
listeners will be allowed to modify the workspace, and post-change listeners
will not.</p>
<p>It will no longer be true that upon completion of a workspace changing
operation, that <code>AUTO_BUILD</code> event listeners will have been notified.
Client code that registers resource change listeners with <code>IWorkspace.addResourceChangeListener(IResourceChangeListener)</code>
is unlikely to be affected by this change because <code>AUTO_BUILD</code>
events were never reported to these listeners. However, clients that use <code>IWorkspace.addResourceChangeListener(IResourceChangeListener,int)</code>
and specify an event mask that includes <code>AUTO_BUILD</code> events are likely to
be broken by this change if they make assumptions about when auto-build
listeners run or what thread they run in. For example, if an auto-build listener
is updating a domain model to reflect changes to the workspace, then this update
might not have happened when the workspace changing operation returns. It is
worth noting that only UI-level code can be affected in this way. Core-level
code that is called via API may be called within the scope of an <code>IWorkspaceRunnable</code>,
so it can never be sure about when resource change listeners will be called. The
suggested fix for this breakage is to use <code>POST_CHANGE</code> instead of build
listeners if it is necessary to have notification occur before the operation
completes.</p>
<h2><a name="Intermediate notifications during workspace operations"></a>22. Intermediate notifications during workspace operations</h2>
<p>It will no longer be guaranteed that all resource changes that occur during
the dynamic scope of an <code>IWorkspaceRunnable</code> will be batched in a
single notification. This mechanism can still be used for batching changes to
avoid unnecessary builds and notifications, but the Platform may now decide to
perform notifications during the operation. This API contract change is not
likely to be a breaking change for existing clients. It is equivalent to the
Platform deciding to call <code>IWorkspace.checkpoint</code> periodically during
a long running operations. The reason for this change is that it is now possible
for multiple threads to be modifying the workspace concurrently. When one thread
finishes modifying the workspace, a notification is required to prevent
responsiveness problems, even if the other operation has not yet completed. This
change also allows users to begin working on a set of resources before the
operation completes. For example, a user can now begin browsing files in a
project that is still in the process of being checked out. The new method <code>IWorkspace.run(IWorkspaceRunnable,
ISchedulingRule, int, IProgressMonitor)</code> has an optional flag, <code>AVOID_UPDATE</code>,
which operations can use as a hint to the platform to specify whether periodic
updates are desired.</p>
<h2><a name="URL stream handler extensions"></a>23. URL stream handler extensions</h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Plug-ins that contribute extensions to the <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.urlHandlers</code>
extension point.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The contract for the <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.urlHandlers</code>
extension point was changed to use the URL Stream Handler service provided by
OSGi. The OSGi support is superior to the one in Eclipse 2.1, and correctly
handles dynamic handlers. Because of various design issues with the base Java
URL handler mechanism, URLStreamHandlers registered with the OSGi handler
service must implement <code>org.osgi.service.url.URLStreamHandlerService</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Formerly, the handler class had to
implement <code>java.net.URLStreamHandler</code> and extend the urlHandlers
extension point. The extension point is no longer supported and the handler must
be updated to implement <code>org.osgi.service.url.URLStreamHandlerService</code>
interface. The OSGi framework provides an abstract base class (<code>org.osgi.service.url.AbstractURLStreamHandlerService</code>)
that can be trivially subclassed to fill this role.</p>
<p>Instead of registering the handler using an extension point, plug-ins must
now do so by registering their handler as a service. For example,</p>
<pre>    Hashtable properties = new Hashtable(1);
    properties.put(URLConstants.URL_HANDLER_PROTOCOL, new String[] {MyHandler.PROTOCOL});
    String serviceClass = URLStreamHandlerService.class.getName();
    context.registerService(serviceClass, new MyHandler(), properties);
</pre>
<h2><a name="Class load order"></a>24. Class load order</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Plug-ins which supply packages provided which are
also supplied by other plug-ins. A very limited number of plug-ins are affected
by this change and some of those affected will actually benefit (see below).</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> In Eclipse 2.x, class loaders search for classes in the
following order: consult (1) parent class loader (in practice this is the Java boot
class loader), then (2) its own classpath contents, and finally (3) all of its prerequisites
in the order declared. OSGi offers an optimization over this model. In this approach a
class loader will consult (1)
parent class loader (again, effectively the Java boot classloader), then either
(2a) a single
prerequisite known to contribute classes in the package being queried or (2b) its
own classpath entries for the desired class.</p>
<p>The class loader determines whether to consult self or its prerequisites based
on its imported and required packages. This information is inferred from the
plug-in content in the case of traditional plug-ins and directly specified in the
case of plug-ins with explicit OSGi bundle manifest. In either case, it is known <i>a priori</i> which class
loaders will supply the classes for which packages. This offers performance
improvements as well as a solution to the vexing problem of multiple
prerequisites contributing the same classes.</p>
<p>Take for example the case of Xerces and Xalan, both of which contain various classes
from org.xml packages. Using the first approach, the Xerces plug-in would see its
copy of these classes while the Xalan plug-in would see their copy. Since these
plug-ins need to communicate, ClassCastExceptions occur. Using the second
approach,
only one of the two plug-ins contributes the duplicate classes and both plug-ins
see the same copies.</p>
<p><b>Action required:</b> The action required depends on the particulars of the
usecase. Affected developers need to review their classpath and resolve any
conflicts which may be happening.</p>
<h2><a name="Class loader protection domain not set"></a>25. Class loader protection domain not set</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Plug-ins that expect the protection domain of their
class loader to be set at all times.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> In Eclipse 2.1 plug-in class loaders were
java.security.SecureClassloaders and, as such, always had a protection domain set. In Eclipse
3.0, class loaders do not extend SecureClassloader and only set the protection
domain if Java security is turned on (not the normal case).</p>
<p><b>Action required:</b> The action required will depend on the scenario in
which the plug-in is using the protection domain.</p>
<h2><a name="PluginModel object casting"></a>26. PluginModel object casting</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Plug-ins which cast objects of type
org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPlugin* to org.eclipse.core.runtime.model.Plugin*Model. Even though the relationship between these interfaces and the
model classes is not specified in the Eclipse 2.1 API, we are explicitly
calling out this change as we have found instances of plug-ins relying on this
relationship in the 2.1 implementation.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> The Eclipse API provides a series of interfaces (e.g., <code>IPluginDescriptor</code>)
and so-called &quot;model&quot; classes (e.g., <code>PluginDescriptorModel</code>)
related to plug-ins and the plug-in registry. In the Eclipse 2.1 implementation
it happens that the model classes implement the relevant interfaces. In the new
OSGi-based runtime, the plug-in registry has been significantly reworked to allow for a
separation between the class loading and prerequisite aspects of plug-ins and the
extension and extension-point aspects. As such the Eclipse 3.0 runtime is unable
to maintain the implementation relationship present in 2.1.</p>
<p><b>Action required:</b>  Plug-ins relying on this non-API
relationship need to be reworked code according to their usecase. More
information on this is given in the recommended changes section of this document
and in the Javadoc for the related classes and methods.</p>
<h2><a name="ILibrary implementation incomplete"></a>27. ILibrary implementation incomplete</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Plug-ins that use <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.ILibrary</code>.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> The new runtime maintains the classpath entries in a
different and incompatible form from Eclipse. As a result, the compatibility
layer is unable to correctly model the underlying OSGi structures as ILibrary
objects. The runtime's compatibility support creates ILibrary objects but must
assume default values for everything except the library's path.</p>
<p><b>Action required:</b> Users of ILibrary should consider accessing the
desired header values (e.g., <code>Bundle-Classpath</code>) from the appropriate
Bundle (see <code>Bundle.getHeaders()</code>) and using the <code>ManifestElement</code>
helper class to interpret the entries. See the class Javadoc for more details.</p>
<h2><a name="Invalid assumptions regarding form of URLs"></a>28 Invalid assumptions regarding form of URLs</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Plug-ins that make assumptions regarding their
installation structure, location and the local file system layout.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> Methods such as <code>IPluginDescriptor.getInstallURL()</code>
return URLs of a particular form. Despite their form being unspecified, various
plug-ins are making assumptions based on the current implementation. For example, they
may expect to get a <code>file:</code> URL and use URL.getFile() and use <code>java.io.File</code>
manipulation on the result. To date, this has been a workable but rather fragile
approach. For example, if a plug-in is installed on a web server, it is possible
that an <code>http:</code> URL would be returned. The new Eclipse 3.0 runtime is
even more flexible and opens more possibilities for execution configurations
(e.g., maintaining whole plug-ins in JARs rather than exploded in directories).
That is, while the new OSGi-based runtime does not actually break 2.1 API, it exposes more
cases where assumptions made in current plug-ins are invalid.</p>
<p><b>Action required:</b> Plug-in writers should ensure that the information to
which they need access is available via <code>getResource()</code> (and is on the
classpath) or use the relevant API for accessing the contents of a plug-in
(e.g., <code>Bundle.getEntry(String)</code>).</p>
<h2><a name="BootLoader methods moved/deleted"></a>29. BootLoader methods moved/deleted</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Non-plug-in code that calls certain methods from the class
<code>org.eclipse.core.boot.BootLoader</code>.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b>  The static methods BootLoader.startup(), shutdown() and run() were
moved to org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter, which is part of the OSGi framework.
This API is the interface between the main() in startup.jar and the OSGi
framework/Eclipse runtime. The restructuring of the runtime did not permit these methods
to remain on BootLoader. The old BootLoader class is now located in the runtime compatibility
layer and is deprecated, and the moved methods are stubbed to do nothing.</p>
<p>There is no replacement for the old BootLoader.getRunnable() as the runtime can no
longer support the acquisition of individual applications. Rather, users must indicate the application of interest when they start the platform.</p>
<p><b>Action required:</b> In general this API is used by very few people (it
cannot be used from within an Eclipse plug-in). In
the rare case that it is, the code must be adapted to use the corresponding methods on
EclipseStarter.</p>

<h2><a name="Plug-in export does not include the plug-in's JARs automatically"></a>30. Plug-in export does not include the
plug-in's JARs automatically</h2>
<p><b>What </b><strong> is affected:</strong> All plug-ins.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In Eclipse 2.1, a plug-in's bin.includes line 
  from their build.properties did not have to contain the list of JARs from their 
  library declaration in the plugin.xml file; these JARs were added for free. 
  In Eclipse 3.0 the list of files in the bin.includes section of the build.properties 
  is an exhaustive list and must include all files which plug-in developers intend 
  to be included in their plug-in when building or exporting.</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Ensure that the bin.includes line from the 
  build.properties file includes all of the JARs listed in your plugin.xml file.</p>


<h2><a name="Re-exporting runtime API"></a>31. Re-exporting runtime API</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Plug-ins that expose API that includes elements from
changed runtime API.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> Various plug-ins expose API that includes elements from
the runtime API. With the changes to the Eclipse 3.0 runtime outlined here,
client plug-ins must re-evaluate their use of runtime API in their API.</p>
<p><b>Action required:</b> This scenario is quite rare as very little of
the Eclipse runtime API is changing. Depending on the scenario, clients may have
to change their API or continue to rely on the the compatibility layer.</p>
<h2><a name="Plug-in parsing methods on Platform"></a>32. Plug-in parsing methods on Platform</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Plug-ins that use <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.parsePlugins(...,
Factory).</code></p>
<p><b>Description:</b> The method <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.parsePlugins(...,
Factory)</code> has been moved. The API associated with the Factory argument has
been moved from the org.eclipse.core.runtime plug-in up to the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in (which depends on the runtime
plug-in). As a result, the parsing method has been moved as well.</p>
<p><b>Action required:</b> Users of this method should use the same method on
the class <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.model.PluginRegistryModel</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="Plug-in libraries supplied by fragments"></a>33. Plug-in libraries supplied by fragments</h2>
<p><b>What </b><strong> is affected:</strong> Plug-ins that specify code on their
classpath but do not supply that code (i.e., the JAR is supplied by a fragment;
for example, the org.eclipse.swt plug-in).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The new runtime must convert plug.xml files to
manifest.mf files behind the scenes. This is done through a straight mechanical transformation and
an analysis of the jars listed and supplied by the plug-in. In the case where a
plug-in specifies a jar on its classpath but does not supply the jar, there is
no code to analyze and the plug-in convertor cannot generate a correct
manifest.mf.</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Providers of such plug-ins must either
change to supply the appropriate jar in the plug-in itself or hand
craft/maintain a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file for their plug-in. Typically this can
be done using PDE to get the initial manifest and then adding in the appropriate
Provide-Package header.</p>
<h2><a name="Changes to build scripts"></a>34. Changes to build scripts</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Scripts (e.g., Ant build.xml
files) which define classpaths containing runtime-related jars and class
directories.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> The new runtime contains a number of new plug-ins and
jars. Their introduction was mandated by the refactoring of the runtime into
configurable pieces. For most runtime situations these changes are transparent.
However, if you have custom build.xml (or similar) scripts which currently
compile code against <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>, you will need to update
them before they will function correctly. A typical script contains a classpath
entry in a &lt;javac&gt; task that references the <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>
plug-in as follows:</p>
<pre>    ../org.eclipse.core.runtime/bin;../org.eclipse.core.runtime/runtime.jar</pre>
<p>The runtime plug-in continues to contain much of the original runtime code.
However, various parts of the runtime which are there only for compatibility
purposes are contained in a compatibility plug-in (<code>org.eclispe.core.runtime.compatibility</code>).
Most of the new runtime code is contained in a collection of plug-ins (<code>org.eclipse.osgi.*</code>).</p>
<p><b>Action required:</b> Developers should add the entries below as needed to
eliminate compilation errors. While the complete set of jars supplied is listed
below, typical uses require only a subset on the classpath at compile time. As
usual, the inclusion of the /bin directories is discretionary. The entries are
given here in logical groupings by supplying plug-in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>../org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility/bin;../org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility/compatibility.jar;</li>
  <li>../org.eclipse.osgi/bin;../org.eclipse.osgi/osgi.jar;</li>
  <li>../org.eclipse.update.configurator/bin;../org.eclipse.update.configurator/configurator.jar;</li>
  <li>../org.eclipse.osgi.util/util.jar;</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition the following jars may be required in special cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>../org.eclipse.osgi/core.jar; ../org.eclipse.osgi/resolver.jar; ../org.eclipse.osgi/defaultAdaptor.jar;
    ../org.eclipse.osgi/eclipseAdaptor.jar; ../org.eclipse.osgi/console.jar</li>
</ul>
<p>While updating such scripts, you should also take the opportunity to clean up
(i.e., remove) references to <code>org.eclipse.core.boot</code>. This plug-in is
obsolete and longer contains any code. The entries can be left on the classpath
but they serve no purpose and should be removed. Look to remove:
</p>
<pre>    ../org.eclipse.core.boot/bin;../org.eclipse.core.boot/boot.jar</pre>
<h2><a name="Changes to PDE build Ant task"></a>35. Changes to PDE build Ant task</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Scripts (e.g., Ant build.xml
files) using the eclipse.buildScript task.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> PDE Build introduced a new property to the eclipse.buildScript task to control the generation of plug-ins build
scripts. This was mandated by the introduction of the new OSGi-based runtime.
</p><p><b>Action required:</b> If you want to use Eclipse 3.0 to build a 2.1 based product, 
then introduce in eclipse.buildScript the property "buildingOSGi" and set it to false.
For example: </p><pre>&lt;eclipse.buildScript ... buildingOSGi=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;</pre>	

<h2><a name="Changes to eclipse.buildScript Ant task"></a>36. Changes to
eclipse.build Ant task</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Scripts (e.g., Ant build.xml files) using the
eclipse.buildScript task.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> PDE Build introduced a new property to the
eclipse.buildScript task to control the generation of plug-ins build scripts.
This was mandated by the introduction of the new OSGi-based runtime.</p>
<p><b>Action required:</b> If you want to use Eclipse 3.0 to build a 2.1 based
product, then introduce in eclipse.buildScript the property &quot;buildingOSGi&quot;
and set it to false. For example:
<pre>&lt;eclipse.buildScript ... buildingOSGi=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;</pre></p>
<h2><a name="Changes to eclipse.fetch Ant task"></a>37. Changes to eclipse.fetch
Ant task</h2>
<p><b>What is affected:</b> Scripts (e.g., Ant build.xml files) using the
eclipse.buildScript task.</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> PDE Build changed the behavior of the eclipse.fetch task
to ease building eclipse in an automated build style. The elements style now
only support one entry at a time and the scriptName is always ignored.</p>
<p><b>Action required:</b> If you had a list of entries in the
&quot;elements&quot; tag of an eclipse.fetch call, spread them out over several
call to eclipse.fetch. If you use to set the scriptName, note that now the
generated fetch script is always called &quot;fetch_{elementId}&quot;. For
example:</p>
<pre>&lt;eclipse.fetch elements=&quot;plugin@org.eclipse.core.runtime, feature@org.eclipse.platform&quot; .../&gt;</pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre>&lt;eclipse.fetch elements=&quot;plugin@org.eclipse.core.runtime&quot; .../&gt;
&lt;eclipse.fetch elements=&quot;feature@org.eclipse.platform&quot; .../&gt;</pre>

<h2><a name="Replacement of install.ini"></a>38. Replacement of install.ini</h2>
<p>The install.ini file is no longer included. In its place is the new
config.ini file in the configuration sub-directory. Products that used the
install.ini file to specify a primary feature (e.g., to provide branding
information) need to make changes to the config.ini file instead. In addition to
the new filename, the names of the keys have changed.</p>
<p>The value of the feature.default.id key in 2.1 should be set as the value of
the new eclipse.product key. The value of the eclipse.application should be set
to &quot;org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2.1 the image for the splash image was always splash.bmp in the
branding plug-in's directory. In 3.0 the location of the splash image is
provided explicitly by the osgi.splashPath key in the config.ini file.</p>
