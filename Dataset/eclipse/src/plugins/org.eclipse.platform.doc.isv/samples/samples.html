<b>Installing the examples</b></h1>

<h3>
 Installing examples via the Update Manager</h3>

<p>
The Eclipse SDK examples are found on the Eclipse project update site at <a href="http://update.eclipse.org/updates">http://update.eclipse.org/updates</a>.
To locate and install them into a product:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the main update manager by clicking <b>Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; Find 
  and Install</b>. This opens the Install Wizard.</li>
  <li> Select &quot;Search for new features&quot; and click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li> In the sites to search page, add an update site by clicking on <b>Add 
  Update Site </b>button: In the Add Update Site dialog that opens, give the site
    the name 
    &quot;Eclipse.org&quot; and URL
	&quot;<a href="http://update.eclipse.org/updates">http://update.eclipse.org/updates</a>&quot;. 
  Note: this step is not needed if the site is already there.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Next</b> and wait for the search results to return all the 
  features found on that site.</li>
  <li>Select the SDK Examples feature and click <b>Next</b>. </li>
  <li>Accept the license and click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li> Select the directory into which the example feature is to be installed and hit <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li> <p>Click <b>Install</b> to allow the downloading and installing
    to proceed.</p></li>
  <li> Click <b>Yes</b> when asked to exit and restart the workbench for the
    changes to take effect. The examples are now installed in the workbench. 
  Note: you can also click on <b>Apply Now</b> to dynamically install the 
  examples into the current configuration.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
 Installing examples manually</h3>
To install the examples without the Update Manager, download the appropriate Eclipse SDK Example zip file from the
Eclipse project web site at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads</a>.
<p>
The workbench should not be running while the examples are being&nbsp;
installed.&nbsp; Extract the contents of the zip file to the root directory&nbsp;
of your Eclipse installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p> For example, if you installed the Eclipse
Project SDK on <b> d:\eclipse-sdk\</b> then extract the contents of the examples
zip file to <b>d:\eclipse-sdk\</b> (the
subdirectories named <b>eclipse</b> should line up).</p>
<p>Start the workbench.&nbsp;The workbench will report that updates have been
detected; accept them. The examples are now installed in the workbench.</p>

<p>You can verify that examples have been installed by looking for <b>File &gt;
New &gt; Example...</b> in the workbench menu bar.</p>
